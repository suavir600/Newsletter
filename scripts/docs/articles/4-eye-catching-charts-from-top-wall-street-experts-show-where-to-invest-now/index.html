      <li>Right now, many UK pension fund providers say they&#x27;re voluntarily aiming to have 5% or more of their assets in domestic assets by 2030.</li>
<li>Pease said he most likes &quot;deep value,&quot; or the cheapest 20% of stocks, calling the trade an &quot;extremely compelling&quot; opportunity.</li>
<li>It&#x27;s unclear what path short-term interest rates will take in the months ahead and in 2026.</li>
<li>&quot;You&#x27;re seeing relative valuations that are close to the same levels they reached in 2021, in the late &#x27;90s,&quot; Pease said.</li>
<li>The above chart shows that the bottom half of the market in terms of valuation level is cheaper relative to the top half than it is 97% of the time going back to 1981.</li>
<li>A simple visual aid can, at times, cut through the noise.</li>
<li>The Fed is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points in September, and if the labor market weakens further, the central bank could institute more cuts.</li>
