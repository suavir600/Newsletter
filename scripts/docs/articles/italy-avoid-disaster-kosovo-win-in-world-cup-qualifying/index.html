<li>Israel have played their &#x27;home&#x27; matches in Hungary since the country&#x27;s offensive in Gaza in retaliation for Hamas&#x27;s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.</li>
<li>Moise Kean wiped out the nominal hosts&#x27; lead on two occasions before Italy went 4-2 ahead on 81 minutes.</li>
<li>The Swedes now sit on just one point after a last-gasp equaliser by Slovenia condemned them to a 2-2 draw on Friday.</li>
<li>Augsburg midfielder Rexhbecaj bundled the hosts ahead on 26 minutes after goalkeeper Robin Olsen saved his initial one-on-one effort.</li>
<li>Premier League record signing Isak was sent on from the bench to try and salvage something for the Swedes inside the final 20 minutes.</li>
<li>- &#x27;No-playing time&#x27; - Sweden&#x27;s slow start to their qualifying campaign continued into matchday two as they went down 2-0 to Kosovo in Pristina.</li>
