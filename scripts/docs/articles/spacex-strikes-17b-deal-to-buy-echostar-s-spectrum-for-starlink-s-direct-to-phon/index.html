      <li>On August 26, EchoStar sold $23 billion worth of spectrum licenses to AT&amp;T.</li>
<li>Of the cash, $2 billion will be made as direct cash interest payments on debt held by EchoStar.</li>
<li>EchoStar will sell its AWS-4 and H-block spectrum licenses in exchange for $8.5 billion in cash and $8.5 billion in SpaceX stock.</li>
<li>As part of the move, EchoStar simultaneously canceled a $1.3 billion contract with Canadian satellite maker MDA Space that was announced just five weeks earlier in August for 100 satellites.</li>
<li>SpaceX said Monday that the new spectrum will enable upgraded satellites with “more than 100 times” the capacity of first-generation Starlink direct-to-cell satellites.</li>
<li>Elon Musk’s SpaceX has agreed to acquire 50 MHz of wireless spectrum and mobile satellite service spectrum licenses from EchoStar for use in the Starlink satellite network.</li>
