    <ul>
      <li>Sure, you gained money instead of losing it, but know that the $1,359 reflects an average annual growth rate of just 6.3%.</li>
<li>Its most recent increase, of 4.8%, was its 63rd consecutive annual increase.</li>
<li>That&#x27;s far less than the average annual gain of close to 10% for the S&amp;P 500 index.</li>
<li>It&#x27;s growing, too, with second-quarter revenue up 5.8% year over year and earnings rising 18%.</li>
<li>Worse still, the S&amp;P 500 has had a great run over the past five years, averaging annual gains of 14.7% -- enough to turn $1,000 into $1,989.</li>
<li>It would be worth $1,359.</li>
<li>For starters, Johnson &amp; Johnson is a dividend-paying stock, with a recent dividend yield of 2.9%.</li>
