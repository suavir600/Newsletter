      <li>- The dividend coverage is very strong at around 57%.</li>
<li>But the patent cliffs that drugmakers are staring down highlight why Alexandria and its 6.2% yield is so attractive, relatively speaking.</li>
<li>They are perfectly fine companies, offering attractive yields of 6.9% and 5.2%, respectively, today.</li>
<li>And this healthcare-focused real estate investment trust&#x27;s huge 6.2% dividend yield is just the start.</li>
<li>Key Points - This ultra-high-yield stock has a 6.2% yield that is 4.5 percentage points higher than the healthcare average.</li>
<li>In fact, if you are looking for dividend income, you&#x27;ll probably need to consider your alternatives, given the sector&#x27;s measly 1.7% average yield.</li>
<li>- The company has increased its dividend annually for 15 years.</li>
