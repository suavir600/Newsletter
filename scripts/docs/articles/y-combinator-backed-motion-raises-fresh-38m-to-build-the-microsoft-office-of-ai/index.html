      <li>They were accepted into the Winter 2020 batch and promptly quit their jobs to go be founders.</li>
<li>In four months, that segment of their business alone grew to over 10,000 B2B customers and $10 million in ARR, Qi tells TechCrunch.</li>
<li>Prices range from $29 per month for one seat, 1,000 credits and limited agent functions, to $600 for 25 seats and all agents, 250,000 credits.</li>
<li>By the time Harry Qi was 23 years old, he had achieved the kind of financial success that most people will never attain: making about $1 million a year.</li>
<li>Their growth led to a 5x oversubscribed $38 million Series C round, led by Stacey Bishop at Scale Venture Partners, and a fast preemptive C2 round at a $550 million post-money valuation.</li>
<li>So in 2019, he and his high school buddy Omid Rooholfada, along with Ethan Yu (Qi’s friend from college — also working at a hedge fund), built an AI calendaring and task management app and applied to Y Combinator.</li>
<li>The startup has raised $75 million to date from investors like HOF Capital, 468 Capital, and SignalFire with participation from Valor Equity Partners, Fellows Fund, Leonis Capital, and some other big names, like the Altm</li>
