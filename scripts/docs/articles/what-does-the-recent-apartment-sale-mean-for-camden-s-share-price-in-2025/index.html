      <li>Projections beyond this period are extrapolated, extending out to 2035 where adjusted free cash flow is forecast to top $1.03 billion.</li>
<li>While the 30-day return is up 2.5%, the year-to-date performance is still down 4.5%, and the stock has slid 9.2% over the past year.</li>
<li>Analyst estimates project steady growth in the coming years, with free cash flow expected to reach $810.8 million by the end of 2029.</li>
<li>Currently, Camden’s free cash flow stands at $738.0 million.</li>
