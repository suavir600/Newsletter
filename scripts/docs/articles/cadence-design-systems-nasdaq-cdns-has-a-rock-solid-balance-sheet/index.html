      <li>And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$1.6b, being 95% of its EBIT.</li>
<li>As you can see below, at the end of June 2025, Cadence Design Systems had US$2.48b of debt, up from US$1.35b a year ago.</li>
<li>So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$747.4m.</li>
<li>However, its balance sheet shows it holds US$3.00b in cash, so it actually has US$522.8m net cash.</li>
<li>Offsetting this, it had US$3.00b in cash and US$753.8m in receivables that were due within 12 months.</li>
<li>So it&#x27;s very unlikely that the US$93.6b company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet.</li>
<li>During the last three years, Cadence Design Systems generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 95% of its EBIT, more than we&#x27;d expect.</li>
