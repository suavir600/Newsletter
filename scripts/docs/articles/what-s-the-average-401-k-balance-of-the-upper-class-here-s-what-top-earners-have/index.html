    <ul>
      <li>Don’t Miss: - Most advisors charge 1% AUM fees and miss critical tax moves — Range helps high earners keep more of their money.</li>
<li>The median balance was $188,000.</li>
<li>But here&#x27;s the real question: how much have the wealthiest 20% actually managed to save in those accounts?</li>
<li>Vanguard&#x27;s Upper-Income Snapshot According to Vanguard&#x27;s 2025 How America Saves report, participants earning $150,000 or more had an average 401(k) balance of roughly $336,000.</li>
<li>median household income hovering around $74,000, that means a starting line of about $150,000 a year.</li>
<li>Still, $150,000 has become the shorthand for where &quot;upper-class&quot; status begins — and where savings habits really start to diverge.</li>
<li>A $336,000 balance may feel substantial, but for a household earning $200,000 a year, it represents only a year and a half of income.</li>
