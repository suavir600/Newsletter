      <li>15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ocean Power Technologies, Inc.</li>
<li>Together, OPT and GM plan to deliver end-to-end solutions that combine proven physical systems with cutting-edge digital simulation.</li>
<li>Taylor Wilson, President and Chief Executive Officer at Gradient Marine, stated: “This partnership is an exciting step for Gradient Marine.</li>
<li>Ocean Power Technologies Announces Strategic Partnership with Gradient Marine to Enhance Digital Twin and Simulation Capabilities MONROE TOWNSHIP, N.J., Sept.</li>
<li>The partnership is also expected to expand OPT’s digital engineering processes, providing powerful new tools for defense, security, and commercial customers seeking to optimize maritime operations.</li>
<li>Not only does it enhance how we develop and test our own platforms, but we believe it will also give our customers a powerful capability to model and rehearse operations before ever putting assets in the water.</li>
<li>VMP users can instantly assess how OPT systems will perform in realistic operating environments to cost-effectively evaluate how OPT technology improves persistent maritime surveillance and supports response activities.”</li>
