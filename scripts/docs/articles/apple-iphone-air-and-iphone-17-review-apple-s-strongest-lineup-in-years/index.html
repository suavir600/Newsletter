      <li>In 2017, Apple introduced an edge-to-edge screen on the iPhone X .</li>
<li>Apple, for instance, said its battery provides up to 27 hours of video playback.</li>
<li>I used it throughout the day — streaming video content, playing games like &quot;Balotro,&quot; incessantly scrolling Reddit and Instagram, and checking my email — and had some 20% left to stream the Mets game at night.</li>
<li>The iPhone Air is just 5.6 millimeters thick.</li>
<li>The iPhone 17 gets Apple&#x27;s standard A19 chip.</li>
<li>The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max get new 8x telephoto zoom cameras and larger batteries.</li>
<li>That makes the iPhone 17 quite an appealing option for folks looking to upgrade their iPhones without having to empty their wallets.</li>
