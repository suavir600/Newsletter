      <li>New benchmarks define how LLMs should be tested in the SOC – measuring real threats, workflows, and outcomes to help defenders AUSTIN, September 15, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fal.Con 2025, Las Vegas -- CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:</li>
<li>To outpace adversaries, organizations must embrace the latest AI technologies.</li>
<li>Cyber defenders face an overwhelming challenge from the influx of security alerts and evolving threats.</li>
<li>Many security teams are still early in their AI journeys, particularly in using LLMs to automate tasks and drive efficiency in security operations.</li>
<li>&quot;Our collaboration with CrowdStrike introduces a new open source benchmark suite to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in real world security scenarios.</li>
<li>Without clear benchmarks, it’s difficult to know which systems, use cases, and performance standards deliver a true AI advantage against real-world attacks.</li>
<li>Meta and CrowdStrike are addressing this challenge by introducing CyberSOCEval, a suite of benchmarks that help define what effective AI looks like for cyber defense.</li>
