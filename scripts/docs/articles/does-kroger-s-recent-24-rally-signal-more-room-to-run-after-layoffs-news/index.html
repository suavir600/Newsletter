      <li>With the current share price at $68.29, this suggests the stock is trading at a 22.8% discount to its estimated fair value.</li>
<li>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Kroger is undervalued by 22.8%.</li>
<li>In just the last year, the stock climbed 24.0%, and over the past five years, it is up a remarkable 127.1%.</li>
<li>Based on these forecasts, Kroger’s annual Free Cash Flow is expected to climb steadily, reaching as high as $3.5 billion by 2035.</li>
<li>So, is the stock cheap or expensive at $68.29?</li>
<li>Beyond that, specialist sources extrapolate until 2035.</li>
<li>Others see it closer to $63.00, reflecting concerns like cost pressures and competition.</li>
