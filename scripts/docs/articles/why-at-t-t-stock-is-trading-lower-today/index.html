      <li>AT&amp;T is up 27.3% since the beginning of the year, and at $29.07 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $29.59 from September 2025.</li>

<li>What Is The Market Telling Us AT&amp;T’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 3 moves greater than 5% over the last year.</li>
<li>The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 7 months ago when the stock gained 7.1% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter results that beat analysts&#x27; EPS expectations.</li>
<li>Investors who bought $1,000 worth of AT&amp;T’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $985.14.</li>
<li>Shares of telecommunications conglomerate AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) fell 1.9% in the morning session after EchoStar announced plans to sell its spectrum licenses to SpaceX, fueling concerns about increased competition in the telecom</li>
