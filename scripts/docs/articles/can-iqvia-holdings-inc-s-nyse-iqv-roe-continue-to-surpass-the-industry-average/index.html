    <ul>
      <li>Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders&#x27; Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for IQVIA Holdings is: 21% = US$1.2b ÷ US</li>
<li>One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders&#x27; capital it has, the company made $0.21 in profit.</li>
<li>As is clear from the image below, IQVIA Holdings has a better ROE than the average (11%) in the Life Sciences industry.</li>
<li>IQVIA Holdings&#x27; Debt And Its 21% ROE IQVIA Holdings clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 2.68.</li>
<li>That&#x27;s clearly a positive.</li>
<li>How To Calculate Return On Equity?</li>
<li>(NYSE:IQV), by way of a worked example.</li>
