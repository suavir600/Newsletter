<li>Additional insights from the report indicate that nearly half (45%) of organisations have appointed a chief risk officer or a senior risk executive equivalent.</li>
<li>Only 27% of executives believe that their ERM process would aid in identifying and managing a significant risk event that could affect their organisation’s reputation and brand.</li>
<li>The report identifies competing priorities and insufficient resources (both at 41%) as the primary barriers, along with a perceived lack of value in risk management efforts (29%).</li>
