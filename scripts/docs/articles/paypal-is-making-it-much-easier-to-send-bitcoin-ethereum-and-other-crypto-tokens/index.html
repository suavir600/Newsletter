      <li>&quot;For 25 years, PayPal has revolutionized how money moves between people.</li>
<li>Earlier this summer, PayPal announced it would begin allowing small businesses to accept payments in over 100 cryptocurrencies.</li>
<li>The program launched today for U.S.</li>
<li>“[This is] helping ensure that personal payments stay personal,” the company said.</li>
<li>Digital assets have become increasingly central to the payment giant’s expansion plans.</li>
<li>The company emphasized Monday that transfers of crypto between friends and families via PayPal and Venmo are exempt from 1099-K reporting, and won’t require additional tax forms.</li>
<li>&quot;Whether you&#x27;re texting, messaging, or emailing, now your money follows your conversations.</li>
