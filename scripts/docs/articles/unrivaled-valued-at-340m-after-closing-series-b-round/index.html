<li>This latest closure builds on last year’s Series A that saw the league reel in $28 million via a round led by Don Berman and his family.</li>
<li>BSP, the leader of the oversubscribed round, also recently led in another Series B round for software company Recall.ai at a $250 million valuation.</li>
<li>Unrivaled, the 3-on-3 women’s pro basketball league co-founded by WNBA stars Breanna Stewart and Napheesa Collier, has closed an oversubscribed Series B funding round at a $340 million valuation.</li>
<li>The six-team alt-league, which now has the top women’s college players marketing its product, has notably become a model for better pay since the inaugural season’s average salary of $220,000 is near the WNBA’s max base</li>
<li>The 23-time Grand Slam champ is also a limited partner in the WNBA’s Toronto Tempo and in NWSL’s Angel City FC.</li>
