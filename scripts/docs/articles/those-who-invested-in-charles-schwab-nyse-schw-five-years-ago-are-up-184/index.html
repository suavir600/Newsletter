      <li>But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%.</li>
<li>That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 23%.</li>
<li>In the case of Charles Schwab, it has a TSR of 184% for the last 5 years.</li>
<li>Over half a decade, Charles Schwab managed to grow its earnings per share at 9.3% a year.</li>
<li>This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 22% per year, over the same period.</li>
<li>One great example is The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) which saw its share price drive 165% higher over five years.</li>
<li>A Different Perspective It&#x27;s nice to see that Charles Schwab shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 49% over the last year.</li>
