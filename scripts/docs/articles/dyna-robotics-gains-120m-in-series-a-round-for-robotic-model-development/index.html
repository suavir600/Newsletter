<li>Gao said: &quot;A strong foundation model is key to scalable distribution.</li>
<li>Dyna Robotics was co-founded by CEO Lindon Gao and York Yang, who previously sold Caper AI for $350m, alongside former DeepMind research scientist Jason Ma.</li>
<li>Dyna Robotics has raised $120m in a Series A funding round led by Robostrategy, CRV, and First Round Capital to accelerate development of its next-generation foundation model.</li>
<li>We are observing true generalisation as our robot enters new environments; it simply works out of the box, with no additional data.&quot; &quot;Dyna Robotics gains $120m in Series A round for robotic model development&quot; was origina</li>
