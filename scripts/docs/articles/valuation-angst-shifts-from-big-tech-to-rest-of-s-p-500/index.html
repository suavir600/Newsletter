<li>The S&amp;P 500 Information Technology index has surged 27%, a rate that looks more restrained when put up against the sector’s earnings growth of 26.9%.</li>
<li>And while the group’s P/E, at 43, is elevated relative to the market, its profit forecasts for growth of 20% in the coming 12 months may partly justify the price.</li>
<li>The industrials and consumer discretionary sectors, for instance, have seen their P/E ratios rise by 17% and 15% this year, significantly outpacing earnings growth for both sectors.</li>
