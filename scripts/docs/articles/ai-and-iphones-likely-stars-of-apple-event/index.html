<li>&quot;I am afraid that Apple&#x27;s incremental innovation approach with the iPhone 17 will start reaching its limits – especially for those who are hungry for more innovation,&quot; he added.</li>
<li>Apple is also reported to be partnering with Google to leverage its search and AI expertise.</li>
<li>Since China remains Apple&#x27;s primary production hub, these trade policies directly impact costs.</li>
<li>Tuesday&#x27;s main attraction should be the new iPhone models, headlined by an ultra-thin &quot;Air&quot; variant.</li>
