<li>A 10% increase in fuel prices would drive an estimated $34.7 million rise in 2025 expenses, partially mitigated by an $18.9 million gain from fuel swap valuations.</li>

<li>In second-quarter 2025, the adjusted EBITDA margin improved 300 basis points year over year to 41%, aided by fuel hedges as well as operational scale.</li>
<li>In second-quarter 2025, NCLH’s fuel expense (as a percentage of total cruise operating expense) came in at 10.8% compared with 12% in the prior-year period.</li>
