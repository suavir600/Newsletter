<li>So it has liabilities totalling US$20.3b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.</li>
<li>Check out our latest analysis for Elevance Health But the bad news is that Elevance Health has seen its EBIT plunge 17% in the last twelve months.</li>
<li>The latest balance sheet data shows that Elevance Health had liabilities of US$43.8b due within a year, and liabilities of US$34.3b falling due after that.</li>
