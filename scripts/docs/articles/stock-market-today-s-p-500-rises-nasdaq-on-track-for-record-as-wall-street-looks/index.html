      <li>As of Monday, the vast majority of bets, around 88%, are on the smaller cut.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) climbed 0.2%.</li>
<li>In corporate moves, Robinhood (HOOD) closed at a record high, up 15% on news it would join the S&amp;P 500.</li>
<li>The S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) moved up around 0.2%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) closed at a record high, up around 0.5% on the day.</li>
<li>LIVE COVERAGE IS OVER 22 updates</li>
<li>The moves come after stocks finished last week on a down note.</li>
<li>The debate now centers on how deep policymakers will cut, amid rising expectations for a bumper &quot;catch-up&quot; move of 50 basis points, rather than 25 basis points.</li>
