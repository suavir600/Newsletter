    <ul>
      <li>YouTube captured 13.4% of U.S.</li>
<li>viewership in July, versus 9.4% for Disney.</li>
<li>Alphabet does not regularly report YouTube&#x27;s revenue, but it disclosed that combined YouTube ad and subscription revenue surpassed $50 billion in the four quarters ending September 2024.</li>
<li>That storied entertainment company made nearly $60 billion in media revenue last year, they estimated.</li>
<li>Mohan said YouTube had paid out more than $100 billion to content makers over the past four years.</li>
<li>Backed by Google&#x27;s deep pockets and market-leading AI know-how, YouTube has stretched its lead over Disney, which dominated the market for most of 2024, according to Nielsen data.</li>
<li>They would be helped, instead, by a host of artificial intelligence-enabled tools that would either reimagine the production process or create new content entirely - a concept that Hollywood fought against during a month</li>
    </ul>
