      <li>At the time of writing, Solana is trading for $235.45 after having gained 1.2% in the past day.</li>
<li>As of Wednesday morning, 90% of predictors think it’ll close the gap before it sees $130 again.</li>
<li>The shares, which trade under the FORD ticker on the Nasdaq, dipped to $31.29 before rebounding to $34.28 at the time of writing—marking a 8.2% fall for the session.</li>
<li>At the time of writing, DFDV shares—which trade on the NasdaqCM—are changing hands for $17.40, about 4.3% lower than their previous close.</li>
