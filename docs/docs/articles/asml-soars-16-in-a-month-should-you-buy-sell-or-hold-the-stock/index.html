    <ul>
      <li>ASML Holding projects 30% growth in EUV revenues in 2025.</li>
<li>The company’s latest financial results for the second quarter of 2025 saw a 23% surge in revenues and a 47% jump in EPS.</li>
<li>ASML shares have rallied 15.9% over the past month.</li>
<li>This performance easily beat the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, which rose 6.2% in the same period.</li>
<li>This indicates a year-over-year increase of merely 2%, which is significantly lower than previous quarters.</li>
<li>This hesitation may delay orders and revenue recognition in late 2025 and 2026, casting doubt on near-term growth continuity.</li>
<li>However, management’s uncertainty about the 2026 growth outlook and premium valuation warrants a cautious approach to the stock.</li>
    </ul>
