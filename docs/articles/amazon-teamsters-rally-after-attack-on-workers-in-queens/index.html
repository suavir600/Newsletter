      <li>And know this: Amazon Teamsters will come out on top.&quot; Drivers and warehouse workers at DBK4 joined the Teamsters in September 2024.</li>
<li>The Teamsters represent nearly 10,000 Amazon workers across the country.</li>
<li>We&#x27;re the ones who made them a $2 trillion corporation,&quot; said Latrice Shadae Johnson, a driver at Amazon DBK4 and member of Teamsters Local 804.</li>
<li>8, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Teamsters and supporters rallied today at Amazon&#x27;s DBK4 facility in Queens following the company&#x27;s sudden and illegal firing over one hundred of its unionized drivers.</li>
<li>&quot;If Amazon thinks we&#x27;re going to take this lying down, they have another thing coming.</li>
<li>We&#x27;re the ones who power their profits.</li>
<li>Our solidarity is only growing stronger.</li>
