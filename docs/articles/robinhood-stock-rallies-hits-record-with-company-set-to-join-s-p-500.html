  <h1>Robinhood stock rallies, hits record with company set to join S&P 500</h1>
  <ul>
<li>Emcor booked revenue of $14.57 billion in 2024.</li>
<li>The company's revenue totaled $2.95 billion in 2024.</li>
<li>For its explosive pandemic-era growth, the company raised $2.1 billion in its July 2021 IPO.</li>
<li>AppLovin closed the day up more than 11%, while Emcor stock remained largely flat, ending the day down less than 1%.</li>
<li>For traders jumping onto the meme-stock frenzy of 2020 and 2021, led in large part by the more than 2,000% gain in GameStop, Robinhood became a platform of choice — its users swelling from 11.7 million users to 21.3 mill</li>
<li>AppLovin, which provides tools including analytics, advertisement technology, and monetization software to developers building apps, saw its market cap grow from around $13.5 billion at the end of 2023 to more than $100</li>
<li>Caesars and MarketAxess both closed out Monday roughly flat after earlier drops, while Enphase lost as much as 3% before making up some of the losses to close down a bit more than 2%.</li>
</ul>
