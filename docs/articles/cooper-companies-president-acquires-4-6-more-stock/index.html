    <ul>
      <li>That equates to 0.6% of the company.</li>
<li>On the other hand they divested 578.00 shares, for US$62k.</li>
<li>Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$1.1m for 15.98k shares.</li>
<li>While that only increased their holding size by 4.6%, it is still a big swing by our standards.</li>
<li>That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$68.09.</li>
<li>Cooper Companies insiders own about US$77m worth of shares.</li>
<li>(NASDAQ:COO) will no doubt be intrigued by the recent purchase of shares by Albert White, President of the company, who spent a stonking US$684k on stock at an average price of US$68.39.</li>
