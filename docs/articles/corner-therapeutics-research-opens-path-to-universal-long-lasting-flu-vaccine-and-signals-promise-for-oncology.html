<li>Corner Therapeutics Research Opens Path to Universal, Long-Lasting Flu Vaccine and Signals Promise for Oncology WATERTOWN, Mass., September 08, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Corner Therapeutics, an in vivo T cell modulation and</li>
<li>This innovative approach represents a fundamental shift in how immunotherapies can be optimized for maximum health.</li>
<li>This finding may open the door for the development of a universal flu vaccine that could eliminate the need for annual immunization.</li>
<li>"This research validates a central dogma in immunology, that dendritic cells are the best conduit to robust T cell responses and immunity.</li>
<li>In this study, the scientists at Corner discovered a new class of drugs, called hyperactivators, which engage nature’s T cell engineers in vivo, the dendritic cells.</li>
<li>The study shows that the technology elicits a broadly acting immune response that targets all strains of influenza present in the commercial quadrivalent influenza vaccine Afluria.</li>
