      <li>Shares of the &quot;Magnificent 7&quot; group of largest companies by market capitalization, which includes Apple ( AAPL ), Nvidia ( NVDA ), Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms ( META ) and Tesla ( TSLA ), were trading less than 1% above or below their prior close.</li>
<li>In the first half of 2025, Amazon and its cloud-computing unit AWS had received approval for more than 12,000 H-1B visas, while Microsoft and Meta Platforms had over 5,000 H-1B visa approvals each.</li>
<li>The Trump administration said on Friday it would ask companies to pay $100,000 per year for H-1B working visas, prompting some Big Tech companies and banks to warn employees to stay in the US or quickly return.</li>

<li>Under the current system, entering the lottery for the visa requires a small fee and, if approved, subsequent fees could amount to several thousand dollars.</li>
<li>Companies including Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ) and Goldman Sachs ( GS ) were among those that sent urgent emails to their employees with travel advisories.</li>
<li>LONDON (Reuters) -Shares in large-cap US technology companies were steady in premarket trading on Monday after President Donald Trump introduced new visa fees as part of his crackdown on immigration.</li>
