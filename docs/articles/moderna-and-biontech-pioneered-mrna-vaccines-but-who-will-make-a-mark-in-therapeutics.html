  <h1>Moderna and BioNTech pioneered mRNA vaccines. But who will make a mark in therapeutics?</h1>
  <ul>
<li>Moderna, which continues its work on vaccines, recently announced plans to lay off 10% of its workforce following the dip in COVID-relarted demand and lackluster sales of its RSV vaccine.</li>
<li>The FDA granted the phase 2 candidate fast track status.</li>
<li>HHS also recently deprioritized mRNA vaccine development, pulling $500 million in funding from projects, and voicing support for a shift to other vaccine platforms.</li>
<li>The company recently secured $153 million in series B funding, even amid a significant contraction in biotech investment, showing enthusiasm for the platform, Becraft said.</li>
<li>Over the next 10 to 15 years, this could lead to expanded opportunities with other companies.</li>
<li>It’s also testing the drug in phase 2 kidney cancer and bladder cancer, among others, according to a second-quarter update.</li>
<li>In May, Strand released promising interim phase 1 results for its lead candidate STX-001 in melanoma and other solid tumors.</li>
</ul>
