  <h1>Italy avoid disaster, Kosovo win in World Cup qualifying</h1>
  <ul>
<li>Sandro Tonali's last-gasp winner edged Italy to a 5-4 victory over Israel in 2026 World Cup qualifying on Monday, while Kosovo beat Sweden despite Alexander Isak making his first appearance of the season.</li>
<li>Israel have played their 'home' matches in Hungary since the country's offensive in Gaza in retaliation for Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.</li>
<li>Moise Kean wiped out the nominal hosts' lead on two occasions before Italy went 4-2 ahead on 81 minutes.</li>
<li>The Swedes now sit on just one point after a last-gasp equaliser by Slovenia condemned them to a 2-2 draw on Friday.</li>
<li>Augsburg midfielder Rexhbecaj bundled the hosts ahead on 26 minutes after goalkeeper Robin Olsen saved his initial one-on-one effort.</li>
<li>Premier League record signing Isak was sent on from the bench to try and salvage something for the Swedes inside the final 20 minutes.</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>'No-playing time' - Sweden's slow start to their qualifying campaign continued into matchday two as they went down 2-0 to Kosovo in Pristina.</li>
