<li>Net burn has remained under $20 million since its founding two years ago, per Bloomberg.</li>
<li>Cognition AI, the startup behind AI coding agent Devin, has hit a $10.2 billion valuation after raising $400 million, marking a jump from the company’s $4 billion valuation earlier this year, reports Bloomberg.</li>
<li>The raise comes after serious growth for Cognition’s core product.</li>
<li>Last month, Cognition laid off 30 staffers and offered buyouts to the remaining 200 employees, offering them a way out of the expectation to work 80-hour, six-day weeks.</li>
<li>At the same time, the company has built a reputation for placing strict demands on its workers.</li>
<li>In July, Cognition acquired AI coding startup Windsurf, just days after Google poached the startup’s CEO, co-founder, and research leads.</li>
