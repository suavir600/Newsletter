<li>He points out that nearly 20% of Apple&#x27;s 1.5 billion users haven&#x27;t upgraded in more than 4 years, calling it a massive opportunity for Tim Cook and team to spark another wave of iPhone sales.</li>
<li>Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also sees stronger demand than last year&#x27;s iPhone 16 launch, saying it could give Apple&#x27;s Q3 results a lift.</li>
<li>Kuo added the Air is a phone that has to be seen in person to appreciate the kind of device that might win you over once it&#x27;s in your hand, even at $999.</li>
<li>Apple&#x27;s ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) iPhone 17 is off to a hot start , with pre-orders climbing this week and analysts saying the buzz is real.</li>
