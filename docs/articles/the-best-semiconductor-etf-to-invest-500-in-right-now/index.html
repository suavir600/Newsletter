    <ul>
      <li>If you invest, say, $10,000 per year in this ETF and it gains, say, 17% annually, you&#x27;ll end up with a stake worth around $82,000 after five years, $262,000 after 10 years, and $1.5 million after 15 years.</li>
<li>(Again, your investment could average higher or lower annual returns than 17%.) Another big plus for this ETF is its low expense ratio (annual fee) of just 0.34%, meaning that you&#x27;ll be charged a whopping $34 per year for every $10,000 you have invested in the fund.</li>
<li>11, 2025.</li>
<li>If you have $500 on hand to invest for the long term, here&#x27;s why it might make sense.</li>
<li>The ETF will usually have at least 80% of its money invested in that index&#x27;s components and it&#x27;s allowed to invest up to 20% in futures, options, swap contracts, cash, and cash equivalents.</li>
<li>Check it out: | iShares Semiconductor ETF | Average Annual Gain | |---|---| | 1 year | 16.91% | | 3 years | 27.95% | | 5 years | 22.42% | | 10 years | 26.12% | | 15 years | 22.65% | Data source: Morningstar.com, as of Sept.</li>
<li>Well, it&#x27;s an index fund, tracking the NYSE Semiconductor Index -- which is made up of U.S.</li>
