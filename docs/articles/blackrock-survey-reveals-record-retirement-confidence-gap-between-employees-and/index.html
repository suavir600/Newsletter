    <ul>
      <li>50% prefer to have their investments managed for them, up from 36% in 2017.</li>
<li>86% of workplace savers now want it - a steady rise from 80% in 2019 - and 74% would save more if their plan had an option for it.</li>
<li>Today’s retirees agree: 91% wish they had access to a solution like a target-date fund, an increase from 84% in 2020.</li>
<li>Economic uncertainty has contributed to a decline in savings rates this year—dipping to a median 10% in 2025, from 12% in 2022.</li>
<li>While confidence has risen 22% across both groups since 2016, closing the gap remains critical, especially given women’s longer lifespans.</li>
<li>The number of retirees who feel prepared financially for the rest of their retirement reached an all-time low at 27%, down from 43% in 2020.</li>
<li>75% say it would be helpful if their employer automatically reallocated their assets by age like a target-date fund would, up from 65% in 2019.</li>
    </ul>
