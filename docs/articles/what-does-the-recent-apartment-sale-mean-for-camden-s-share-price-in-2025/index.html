    <ul>
      <li>Projections beyond this period are extrapolated, extending out to 2035 where adjusted free cash flow is forecast to top $1.03 billion.</li>
<li>While the 30-day return is up 2.5%, the year-to-date performance is still down 4.5%, and the stock has slid 9.2% over the past year.</li>
<li>Analyst estimates project steady growth in the coming years, with free cash flow expected to reach $810.8 million by the end of 2029.</li>
<li>Currently, Camden’s free cash flow stands at $738.0 million.</li>
<li>Someone more cautious about oversupply risks might set it closer to $112.00.</li>
<li>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Camden Property Trust is undervalued by 37.0%.</li>
<li>Yet, if you take a step back, the five-year picture shows a rather handsome gain of 49.2%, which is not a bad run for patient investors.</li>
