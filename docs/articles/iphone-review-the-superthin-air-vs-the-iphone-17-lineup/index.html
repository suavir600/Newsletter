    <ul>
      <li>The battery went from 8% to 70% in under an hour.</li>
<li>iPhone 17 Pro ($1,099 and up): The Pros are premium.</li>
<li>iPhone 17 ($799 and up): This is the iPhone most people should get.</li>
<li>iPhone Air ($999 and up): Its polished titanium frame is beautiful.</li>
<li>The $999-and-up iPhone Air puts a priority on sleekness over battery and camera.</li>
<li>- Poppy Lynch for WSJ iPhone 17 Pro Max ($1,199 and up): I never understood the Max until I tested this one.</li>
<li>The day I really used up the Air’s juice while camera testing, I tried the new, made-for-Air MagSafe battery pack ($99).</li>
    </ul>
