    <ul>
      <li>Workday is down 6.9% since the beginning of the year, and at $234.56 per share, it is trading 16.2% below its 52-week high of $279.91 from December 2024.</li>
<li>The finance and HR software provider reported calendar second-quarter revenue of $2.35 billion, up 12.6% year over year, which was in line with Wall Street&#x27;s expectations.</li>
<li>Shares of enterprise software company Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) jumped 8% in the morning session after activist investor Elliott Management disclosed a more than $2 billion stake and praised the company&#x27;s leadership.</li>
<li>Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.21, beating the consensus estimate of $2.12.</li>
<li>Workday’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 7 moves greater than 5% over the last year.</li>
<li>Investors may have also been concerned about slowing growth, as the 12.6% revenue increase represents a deceleration from the company&#x27;s 16.4% compounded annual growth rate over the last three years.</li>
<li>The previous big move we wrote about was 26 days ago when the stock dropped 3.6% on the news that the company reported second-quarter results that, while beating profit estimates, failed to impress on the top line.</li>
    </ul>
