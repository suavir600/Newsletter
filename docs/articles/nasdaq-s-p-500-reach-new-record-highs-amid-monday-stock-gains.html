  <h1>Nasdaq, S&P 500 reach new record highs amid Monday stock gains</h1>
  <ul>
<li>Tesla up 3.6%.</li>
<li>5/10 of 1%, Amgen down 7/10 of a percent.</li>
<li>And there you see Oracle back in the green up 3% and Shopify also up about 3%.</li>
<li>And so now Tesla and Alphabet, really the drivers of a big part of the action today, but also contributing, we got Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Meta, each of those up more than 1%.</li>
<li>There you go, up 1 and a half% year to date.</li>
<li>US stocks (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) close out Monday's session in positive territory, the Nasdaq Composite leading the charge with a 0.95% gain and notching a new record high alongside the S&amp;P 500.</li>
