    <ul>
      <li>Purchases are rare from Musk, who last purchased $10 million of Tesla&#x27;s shares back in February 2020.</li>
<li>Tesla (TSLA) stock pops after CEO Elon Musk bought roughly $1 billion in shares.</li>
<li>And I&#x27;m not sure if this has been mentioned yet, but Elon hasn&#x27;t bought shares since 2020.</li>
<li>100% and it&#x27;s a sign that he is all in, especially after the company&#x27;s board proposed that massive pay package with some really lofty targets in there.</li>
<li>All right, when billionaires bet on themselves, a charge has been sent through Tesla&#x27;s stock on news Elon Musk bought 2.57 million shares at various prices on Friday for a total of about $1 billion.</li>
<li>He says, these buys are a a clear sign of confidence by Musk in the outlook for Tesla.</li>
<li>I&#x27;m not so sure with the economy slowing down, so this might be more of a temporary pop.</li>
    </ul>
