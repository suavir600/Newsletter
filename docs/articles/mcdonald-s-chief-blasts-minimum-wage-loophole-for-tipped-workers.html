  <h1>McDonald’s Chief Blasts Minimum Wage Loophole for Tipped Workers</h1>
  <ul>
<li>While the federal minimum wage is $7.25, tipped workers only have to be paid $2.13, with tips expected to make up the difference.</li>
<li>Tip Fatigue: Tipping has encountered significant backlash in recent years as people have been faced with the dreaded “Leave a tip?” prompt on an iPad with some choices upward of 25%.</li>
<li>This post first appeared on The Daily Upside.</li>
<li>But workers in many industries still depend on tips.</li>
<li>IHOP has an advantage over McDonald’s, and it’s not four types of syrup.</li>
<li>Full-service restaurants, however, have tips built into their business model.</li>
<li>As tipping fatigue has gained fame (and meme status), Americans are tipping less.</li>
</ul>
