      <li>dollar diminishes is gold as a reserve currency.&quot; In his view, strong central-bank demand and growing trade tensions could drive bullion prices toward $5,000 an ounce by 2028.</li>
<li>ESGold&#x27;s two key projects together provide visibility on 2026 production.</li>
<li>The junior mining sector is notoriously high risk, with fewer than 0.1% of exploration projects ever becoming producing mines.</li>
<li>Goldman Sachs now forecasts gold prices reaching $3,700 by the end of 2025 and $4,000 by mid-2026, with the possibility of $4,500 per ounce if private investors exit dollar assets in favor of bullion.</li>
<li>(NYSE: FCX) is reporting strong operating performance in its Q2 2025 and six-month 2025 results, including quarterly gold and copper sales volumes above April 2025 guidance as well as quarterly unit net cash costs that landed significantly below April 2025 guidance.</li>
<li>Both projects are expected to move into production in 2026, giving ESGold visibility on near-term cash flow from multiple jurisdictions.</li>
<li>By completing Montauban and advancing the Bolívar project, ESGold is positioned as a fully funded execution story with visible 2026 cash flow.</li>
