  <h1>Dyna Robotics gains $120m in Series A round for robotic model development</h1>
  <ul>
<li>This robotic foundation model is claimed to have achieved a success rate of over 99% during 24-hour continuous operations.</li>
<li>“The demand for robotic automation spans almost every industry, and we believe Dyna will be at the forefront in meeting it with their state-of-the-art general-purpose robot foundation model.” Since securing a $23.5m seed</li>
<li>Within six months of launching DYNA-1, the company reported that its robots had been operational for up to 16 hours daily in diverse settings such as hotels, restaurants, and gyms.</li>
<li>Gao said: "A strong foundation model is key to scalable distribution.</li>
<li>Dyna Robotics was co-founded by CEO Lindon Gao and York Yang, who previously sold Caper AI for $350m, alongside former DeepMind research scientist Jason Ma.</li>
<li>Dyna Robotics has raised $120m in a Series A funding round led by Robostrategy, CRV, and First Round Capital to accelerate development of its next-generation foundation model.</li>
<li>We are observing true generalisation as our robot enters new environments; it simply works out of the box, with no additional data." "Dyna Robotics gains $120m in Series A round for robotic model development" was origina</li>
