      <li>Musk had launched xAI in July 2023 as an alternative to OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT.</li>
<li>Anthropic had said it raised $13 billion at a post-money valuation of $183 billion earlier this month.</li>
<li>The $200 billion valuation would be an over twofold jump from the $75 billion in July, according to data from Pitchbook.</li>
<li>(Reuters) - Elon Musk &#x27;s xAI has raised $10 billion, bringing the AI firm&#x27;s post-money valuation to $200 billion, CNBC reported on Friday citing sources.</li>
<li>Morgan Stanley had said in late June xAI had completed a $5 billion debt raise alongside a separate $5 billion strategic equity investment, as the startup looked to expand its AI infrastructure through data centers amid intense competition.</li>
<li>OpenAI is in early-stage discussions about a stock sale that would allow employees to cash out and could value the company at about $500 billion, Reuters had reported in August, while ByteDance is set to launch a new employee share buyback that will value the Chinese technology giant at more than $330 billion.</li>
<li>xAI did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.</li>
