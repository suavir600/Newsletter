    <ul>
      <li>HOOD is +8% at this hour, while APP is +9%.</li>
<li>This level was in between the near-term high +3.0% in January and +2.3% in April.</li>
<li>For PPI, much the same: +3.3% last time and +2.8% on core — springing up from recent lows on both metrics.</li>
<li>Bond yields continue to gradually shrink before our eyes: the 10-year is now down to +4.07% and the 2-year is +3.49%.</li>
<li>Core CPI last time around was +3.1%, back to where we were in February of this year and above the March, April, May level of +2.8%, which was the lowest print since March 2021.</li>
<li>That April print was the closest we had come since the Great Reopening to the Fed’s optimum +2% inflation rate.</li>
<li>Year-over-year CPI, aka the Inflation Rate, is expected to come up 20 basis points (bps) to +2.9% from the +2.7% reported over the previous two months.</li>
    </ul>
