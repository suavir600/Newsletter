      <li>Analysts expect Free Cash Flow to reach $7.3 Billion by 2029.</li>
<li>Zoom out even further and Palantir’s three-year return sits at a jaw-dropping 2,134.4%.</li>
<li>PLTR Discounted Cash Flow as at Sep 2025 Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Palantir Technologies may be overvalued by 123.5%.</li>
<li>Others see it closer to $66 due to concerns over competition and valuation risk.</li>
<li>Even this past week, the stock posted a 4.9% gain, bouncing back from a minor dip of -3.9% over the past month.</li>
<li>For example, some investors think Palantir’s fair value could be as high as $112, thanks to rapid AI revenue growth.</li>
