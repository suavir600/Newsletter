  <h1>Should You Reconsider Cisco After Recent Price Dip Despite Industry Volatility?</h1>
  <ul>
<li>Cisco is up 13.2% year to date and an astonishing 92.7% over the last five years.</li>
<li>Analyst projections see this rising steadily, with Free Cash Flow estimated to reach $17.52 billion by 2030.</li>
<li>Based on these projections, Cisco’s DCF intrinsic value lands at $70.23 per share.</li>
<li>In just the past week, shares have slipped 3.2%, and the past month brought a 6.8% stumble.</li>
<li>Comparing that to the current share price reveals the stock is trading at a 4.7% discount to its estimated fair value.</li>
<li>Cisco Systems is generating strong Free Cash Flow, with the most recent figure at $13.37 billion.</li>
<li>For example, looking at Cisco, one Narrative might see rapid AI adoption and global digitization driving a fair value estimate as high as $87, while another might focus on rising competition and set a value closer to $61</li>
