  <h1>The Nasdaq Hit a Fresh Record. The AI Trade Is Back On.</h1>
  <ul>
<li>The Dow was up 52 points, or 0.1%, after bouncing between small gains and losses.</li>
<li>The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.4%, but only because of contributions from Broadcom, Lam Research, Palantir Technologies, Nvidia, among other AI-linked stocks; roughly 318 stocks in the index were trading down on the day.</li>
<li>The Nasdaq Composite hit its highest level on record and was on track for a fresh closing high on a mixed Monday for the broader market.</li>
</ul>
