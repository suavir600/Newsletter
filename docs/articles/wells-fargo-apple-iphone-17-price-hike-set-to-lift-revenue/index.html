    <ul>
      <li>Meanwhile, the iPhone 17 Pro Max could come in at $1,299, $1,499, and $1,699, also reflecting $100 increases.</li>
<li>The iPhone 17 Pro is expected to be priced at $1,099, $1,299, and $1,599, each tier $100 higher than the 16 Pro line.</li>
<li>Rakers, who holds an Overweight rating and a $245 price target on Apple, said his model projects iPhone revenue of $218.3 billion over the next 12 months, nearly in line with Wall Street&#x27;s $218.2 billion estimate.</li>
<li>Apple&#x27;s annual fall product event takes place tomorrow, with the iPhone 17 lineup and updates to the Apple Watch expected.</li>
<li>The iPhone 17 Air, a thinner design, could start at $1,099 and run as high as $1,499, partly because Apple may remove the 128GB entry option and introduce a new 1TB version.</li>
<li>Analyst Aaron Rakers noted that the new iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are all expected to carry price increases ranging from $100 to $300 compared to last year&#x27;s iPhone 16 models.</li>
<li>Sep 8 - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may see more revenue upside from its upcoming iPhone 17 launch as Wells Fargo highlights higher pricing across the product line.</li>
