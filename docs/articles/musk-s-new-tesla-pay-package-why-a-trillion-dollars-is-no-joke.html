  <h1>Musk's New Tesla Pay Package: Why a Trillion Dollars Is No Joke</h1>
  <ul>
<li>A proposed pay package worth up to $1 trillion for Tesla’s gag-loving boss is totally serious, but it almost sounds like Dr.</li>
<li>Evil’s nuclear blackmail demand for $100 billion in “Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.” Unable to stop laughing, the president tells him it’s more than all the money in the world in 1969.</li>
<li>Individual companies’ ratios vary wildly.</li>
<li>The odds of Elon Musk getting the full sum are slim.</li>
</ul>
