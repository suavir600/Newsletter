    <ul>
      <li>So far this year, UPS shares have fallen more than 32%, including a 3% decline just in the past month.</li>
<li>Result: Fair Value of $103.30 (UNDERVALUED) Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what&#x27;s behind the forecasts.</li>
<li>As the stock trades around $84, the question is front and center: is the market being too pessimistic about United Parcel Service, or does this drop reflect a realistic outlook on future growth?</li>
<li>According to the most widely-followed narrative, United Parcel Service stock appears undervalued by nearly 19%, with analysts pointing to longer-term catalysts that could support a higher valuation despite near-term volatility.</li>
<li>UPS Discounted Cash Flow as at Sep 2025 Simply Wall St performs a discounted cash flow (DCF) on every stock in the world every day ( check out United Parcel Service for example ).</li>
<li>That is a tough run, especially considering some modest gains in annual revenue and net income.</li>
<li>If you save a screener we even alert you when new companies match - so you never miss a potential opportunity.</li>
    </ul>
