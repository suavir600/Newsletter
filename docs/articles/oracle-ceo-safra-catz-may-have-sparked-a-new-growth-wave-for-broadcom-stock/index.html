    <ul>
      <li>In the third quarter, AI revenue rose 63% year over year to $5.2 billion, with 65% coming from its custom accelerator (XPU) business.</li>
<li>Revenue grew 22% year over year to $16 billion, while adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization surged 30% year over year to $10.7 billion.</li>
<li>Management now expects AI revenue growth in fiscal 2026 to be faster than in fiscal 2025.</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $651,345 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005...</li>
<li>Since demand far exceeds available data center capacity, Oracle is planning capital expenditures of nearly $35 billion in fiscal 2026, largely for data center equipment.</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,080,327 !* Now, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,058 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 189% for the S&amp;P 500.</li>
<li>Oracle CEO Safra Catz and chairman Larry Ellison unveiled ambitious plans to build global artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, supported by $455 billion in remaining performance obligations (RPO), a measure of the backlog of signed contracts -- an increase of 359% on a year-over-year basis.</li>
