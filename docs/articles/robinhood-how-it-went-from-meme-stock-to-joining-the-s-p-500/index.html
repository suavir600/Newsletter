      <li>But look, this is a stock that has a had a remarkable run, 190% up year to date.</li>
<li>The stock trading higher early in the session, up 13% after it was announced late Friday, the company would be added to the S&amp;P 500.</li>
<li>60 to 8 something like that between 2021, 2023.</li>
<li>So, Robin Hood, over the past 12 months, they&#x27;ve earned $1.8 billion.</li>
<li>So, I remember when this stock was in November of 2023 was trading at around $8 a share and Wall Street was talking about Robin Hood as being a potential target.</li>
<li>So strategy was snubbed from the S&amp;P 500.</li>
<li>They&#x27;ve got 24/7 trading in a lot of stocks.</li>
