      <li>In the second quarter, revenue climbed 22% year over year to $47.5 billion, fueling diluted earnings per share (EPS) that jumped 38% to $7.14.</li>
<li>If the company can achieve that benchmark, it could surpass a $3 trillion market cap as early as 2029.</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $640,916 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005...</li>
<li>For instance, ExxonMobil and General Electric ruled the roost in 2005, with market caps $375 billion and $362 billion, respectively.</li>
<li>Wall Street&#x27;s estimates have the company generating revenue of $196 billion in 2025, giving the stock a forward price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of about 10.</li>
<li>Meta has a market cap of roughly $1.93 trillion (as of this writing), so it will take a stock price increase of roughly 55% to lift its value to $3 trillion.</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,090,012 !* Now, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,052 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 188% for the S&amp;P 50</li>
