      <li>Their footprint in Europe is growing fast, with JATO data showing that Chinese brands captured 5.1% of new car registrations in the first half of 2025, nearly double from a year earlier.</li>
<li>Mexico’s recent move to impose a 50% tariff on Chinese vehicle imports adds another layer of complexity.</li>
<li>Another 2.9% came from Chinese-owned brands, much of it focused on battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles.</li>
<li>It aims to produce all of its European EVs locally by 2028, starting with its Surf model from a Hungarian plant.</li>
<li>Hongqi is targeting 15 model launches in Europe by 2028, while Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) has entered 10 European markets and is opening an R&amp;D center in Germany.</li>
<li>That, analysts warned, could raise the risk of a “back door” entry into the U.S.</li>
<li>BYD (HK:1211), for example, now offers 13 models in Europe, up from six just two years ago, and plans to operate more than 1,000 stores across 32 countries by year-end.</li>
