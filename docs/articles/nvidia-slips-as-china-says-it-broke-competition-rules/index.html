    <ul>
      <li>China accounts for about 13% of Nvidia&#x27;s revenue, or $17 billion last year.</li>
<li>Nvidia&#x27;s stock fell 2.1% in premarket trading Monday.</li>
<li>That means penalties which could run up to 10% of annual sales under Chinese law would sting, but the bigger concern is whether regulators limit how Nvidia can bundle Mellanox technology into its chips.</li>
<li>The State Administration for Market Regulation pointed to commitments Nvidia made when it bought Mellanox Technologies in 2020, including a promise to keep supplying GPU accelerators to China.</li>
<li>U.S.</li>
<li>The announcement came just as U.S.</li>
<li>The timing wasn&#x27;t lost on investors.</li>
    </ul>
