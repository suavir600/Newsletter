      <li>Eaton and Xendee Collaborate to Optimize Microgrid Performance Using AI-Powered Tools for Greater Energy Savings, Security and Sustainability - Combined solution further automates cloud-based energy optimization and adva</li>
<li>According to the International Energy Agency, adoption of AI across the buildings sector alone could save up to 300-terawatt-hours (TWh) of energy annually.</li>
<li>Xendee’s solution is hardware agnostic, allowing DER operators to seamlessly manage over 27 different types of technologies, including solar, battery energy storage systems, nuclear, linear generators, and combined heat</li>
<li>Together, the companies will provide customers a streamlined path to design, deploy and operate highly efficient, resilient microgrids and DERs.</li>
<li>The solution will unlock real-time operational adjustments for microgrid systems that help lead to significant cost savings, enhanced resilience, reduced emissions and extended equipment lifespans.</li>
<li>Xendee’s cutting-edge microgrid modeling and operations platform combined with Eaton’s engineering expertise and proven power distribution technologies deliver a fully integrated microgrid solution.</li>
<li>Eaton and Xendee will help customers leverage AI for new and existing microgrids using onsite energy sources, to sustainably meet energy demands, strengthen energy resilience and drive substantial operating cost savings.</li>
