  <h1>Carnival's Fuel Efficiency Gains Momentum: Can Margins Sustain?</h1>
  <ul>
<li>RCL expects fuel expenses of $1.14 billion in 2025 and has hedged 66% of its needs at below-market rates.</li>
<li>A 10% increase in fuel prices would drive an estimated $34.7 million rise in 2025 expenses, partially mitigated by an $18.9 million gain from fuel swap valuations.</li>
<li>To further insulate margins, NCLH has hedged roughly 65% of 2025, 48% of 2026 and 22% of 2027 projected fuel purchases.</li>
<li>Management reaffirmed its $300 million cumulative cost-savings target by 2026, highlighting fuel initiatives as a key contributor.</li>
<li>In second-quarter 2025, the adjusted EBITDA margin improved 300 basis points year over year to 41%, aided by fuel hedges as well as operational scale.</li>
<li>In second-quarter 2025, NCLH’s fuel expense (as a percentage of total cruise operating expense) came in at 10.8% compared with 12% in the prior-year period.</li>
<li>Notably, CCL confirmed that it has already achieved its 20% carbon intensity reduction target relative to 2019 levels, more than a year ahead of the 2026 goal.</li>
