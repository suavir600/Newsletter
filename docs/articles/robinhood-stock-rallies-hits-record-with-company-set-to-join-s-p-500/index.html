<li>AppLovin, which provides tools including analytics, advertisement technology, and monetization software to developers building apps, saw its market cap grow from around $13.5 billion at the end of 2023 to more than $100</li>
<li>Caesars and MarketAxess both closed out Monday roughly flat after earlier drops, while Enphase lost as much as 3% before making up some of the losses to close down a bit more than 2%.</li>
