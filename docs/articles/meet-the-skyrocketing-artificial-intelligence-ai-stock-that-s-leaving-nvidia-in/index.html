    <ul>
      <li>The company reported a 37% year-over-year increase in the metric in Q2 2024, indicating that its future revenue pipeline growth is ticking up.</li>
<li>That&#x27;s why Nvidia&#x27;s returns of 32% so far in 2025 may appear lukewarm to investors.</li>
<li>Moreover, the analysts at Fortune Business Insights forecast that demand for edge AI will increase at an impressive annualized rate of 33% through 2032.</li>
<li>This metric refers to the total value of a company&#x27;s unfulfilled contracts, and it&#x27;s worth noting that Cloudflare&#x27;s RPO growth substantially exceeded the 28% year-over-year spike in its Q2 revenue to $512 million.</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $651,345 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005...</li>
<li>One of these is Cloudflare (NYSE: NET) , which has significantly outperformed Nvidia so far this year -- it&#x27;s up by a remarkable 110% -- and has the potential to fly higher.</li>
<li>The company landed several multimillion-dollar contracts for Workers AI in the second quarter, which explains the impressive 39% year-over-year increase in its remaining performance obligations (RPO) to almost $2 billion.</li>
    </ul>
