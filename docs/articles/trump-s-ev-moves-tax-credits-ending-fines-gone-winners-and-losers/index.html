      <li>While that sounds strong, it’s down nearly 50% from the $890 million it earned a year earlier.</li>
<li>GM has spent $3.5 billion on credits since 2022, while Ford has cut $1.5 billion in similar purchases this year.</li>
<li>Rivian said regulatory credits made up 6.5% of its total revenues in the first half of 2025, but it doesn’t expect any credit sales for the rest of the year.</li>
<li>Since 2019, Tesla has generated over $10.6 billion from credit sales—profits that often made the difference during lean quarters.</li>
<li>Last year, Rivian earned more than $400 million from these sales.</li>
<li>In the last reported quarter alone, Tesla booked $439 million from credits.</li>
<li>GM CFO Paul Jacobson echoed the sentiment, saying the removal of fines will start saving the company money as early as 2026.</li>
    </ul>
