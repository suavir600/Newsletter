  <h1>JPM starts Cognex with Neutral view, sees AI potential but near-term risks</h1>
  <ul>
<li>JPMorgan expects margins to improve over time, with EBITDA rising from about 19% in 2024 to 25% by 2028, supported by sales transformation, operating leverage and R&amp;D efficiency.</li>
<li>Cognex currently trades at about 31 times estimated 2026 EBITDA and 39 times earnings, a premium to industrial technology peers.</li>
<li>“Upside could be realized if AI adoption scales faster and margins surpass 25%, but customer concentration and intensifying competition present ongoing headwinds,” JPMorgan said.</li>
<li>Investing.com -- JPMorgan initiated coverage of Cognex with a Neutral rating and a $45 price target, saying the machine vision company has strong long-term prospects but limited upside at current levels.</li>

<li>Cognex’s asset-light model also gives it strong free cash flow to fund acquisitions, dividends and buybacks.</li>
<li>“Cognex aims to double its customer base in the next five years,” JPMorgan wrote, but added that execution will be key as the company scales beyond pilots.</li>
