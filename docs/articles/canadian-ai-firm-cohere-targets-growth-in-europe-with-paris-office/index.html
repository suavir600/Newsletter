      <li>Mistral, valued this month at $11.7 billion, declined to comment on Cohere&#x27;s offering in Europe.</li>
<li>Founded in 2019, Cohere already counts major global companies such as South Korea&#x27;s LG, Japan&#x27;s Fujitsu and Oracle in the U.S.</li>
<li>Cohere, which was valued at $6.8 billion in its latest funding round, opened an office in Paris on Monday and is keen to take a bigger share of Europe&#x27;s growing demand, said CEO Aidan Gomez.</li>
