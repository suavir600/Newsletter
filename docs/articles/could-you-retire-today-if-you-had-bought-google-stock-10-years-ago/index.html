    <ul>
      <li>As of late 2025, Alphabet trades around $251.</li>
<li>In late 2015, Google stock (GOOGL) closed around $37 (split-adjusted).</li>
<li>Someone who invested $2,000 in Google in 2015 would have about $13,400 today.</li>
<li>To reach that from Google stock alone, you would have needed to invest roughly $150,000 in 2015.</li>
<li>If you need $60,000 annually, you’d need about $1,500,000 saved, requiring about $225,000 invested in Google in 2015.</li>
<li>Today, it’s worth about $251 per share.</li>
<li>Most people don’t have $100,000+ sitting around to invest in a single stock.</li>
    </ul>
