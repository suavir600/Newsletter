    <ul>
      <li>Sep 15 - Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares slipped about 1.5% in Monday trading after Chinese authorities moved against the company.</li>
<li>China&#x27;s State Administration for Market Regulation says a preliminary probe found Nvidia failed to meet conditions tied to its 2020 purchase of Mellanox Technologies, and the agency plans further investigation.</li>
<li>Nvidia did not immediately comment.</li>
<li>This article first appeared on GuruFocus.</li>
<li>The regulator did not lay out specific breaches.</li>
<li>Watch for follow-up from Beijing or a formal response from Nvidia; either could move sentiment again.</li>
<li>Investors reacted quickly as the market priced in the risk of a prolonged regulatory review.</li>
