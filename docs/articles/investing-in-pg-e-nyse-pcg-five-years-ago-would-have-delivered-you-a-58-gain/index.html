    <ul>
      <li>Meanwhile, EPS is up 116% per year.</li>
<li>Unfortunately the share price is down 24% in the last year.</li>
<li>We can see that the PG&amp;E share price is up 14% in the last three years.</li>
<li>This EPS growth is higher than the 5% average annual increase in the share price over the same three years.</li>
<li>Longer term investors wouldn&#x27;t be so upset, since they would have made 10%, each year, over five years.</li>
<li>A Different Perspective While the broader market gained around 22% in the last year, PG&amp;E shareholders lost 23% (even including dividends).</li>
<li>But PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 57% over five years, which is below the market return.</li>
