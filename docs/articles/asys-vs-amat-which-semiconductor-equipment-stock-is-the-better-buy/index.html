    <ul>
      <li>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMAT’s fiscal 2025 and 2026 revenues indicates year-over-year growth of 4.5% and 2.7%, respectively.</li>
<li>Applied Materials’ Sym3 Magnum etch system has generated more than $1.2 billion in revenues since its launch in February 2024.</li>
<li>Additionally, in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, management projects AMAT&#x27;s revenues from DRAM customers to grow more than 50% in fiscal 2025.</li>
<li>Though the consensus mark for top-line estimates for fiscal 2025 revenues suggests a decline of 24.4%, it is forecasted to mark a recovery in fiscal 2026 with an estimated year-over-year increase of 4.6%.</li>
<li>During the third quarter, sales of equipment used in AI infrastructure were five times higher than a year ago and made up about 25% of Thermal Processing Solutions’ revenues.</li>
<li>In alignment with this positive momentum, Amtech Systems projected revenues of $17-$19 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, where growth in AI-related equipment sales is expected to be the major growth catalyst</li>
<li>During the last earnings call, management stated that these steps have resulted in $13 million of annual savings.</li>
