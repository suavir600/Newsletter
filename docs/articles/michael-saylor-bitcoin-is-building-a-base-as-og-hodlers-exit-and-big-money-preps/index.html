      <li>If you zoom out and look at the one-year chart, bitcoin is up 99%,” he said.</li>
<li>He predicted bitcoin would continue to appreciate at an average rate near 29% annually over the next two decades, fueling new forms of credit and equity instruments.</li>
<li>He outlined the firm’s suite of preferred-stock products — Strike, Strife, Stride, and Stretch — which are designed to provide investors with yields of up to 12% while being heavily over-collateralized with bitcoin.</li>
<li>He expects eventual inclusion as the market grows more comfortable with the bitcoin treasury model, which he dates to late 2024.</li>
<li>Saylor also addressed why Strategy has yet to be included in the S&amp;P 500 despite its scale and profitability.</li>
<li>As everyone embraces it, peace will spread, equity will spread, fairness will spread.</li>
<li>Bitcoin is a peaceful, fair, and equitable way for us to settle our differences,” he said.</li>
    </ul>
