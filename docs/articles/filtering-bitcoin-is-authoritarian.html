  <h1>Filtering Bitcoin is authoritarian</h1>
  <ul>
<li>The Great Bitcoin Filter Debate of 2025 rages on, and it’s getting pretty brutal.</li>
<li>Despite 100% of users filtering transactions with extremely low fee rates, those transactions were still being mined in over half of the blocks.</li>
<li>In other words, even with 100% filtering we still see the iron laws of economics prevail: if there’s a paying customer, someone will cash the check.</li>
