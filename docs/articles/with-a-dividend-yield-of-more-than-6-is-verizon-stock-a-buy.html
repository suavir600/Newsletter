<li>At a recent price near $44, that implies a yield just over 6%.</li>
<li>Second-quarter revenue rose 5.2% year over year to $34.5 billion, with wireless service revenue up 2.2%.</li>
<li>Additionally, business wireless retail postpaid churn was 1.61%.</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $640,916!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005...</li>
<li>Shares have hovered around the mid-$40s recently, putting the stock's dividend yield north of 6% after the board's early September increase.</li>
<li>Consumer wireless retail postpaid churn was 1.12% in the second quarter of 2025 as the company leaned into promotions amid a competitive backdrop.</li>
