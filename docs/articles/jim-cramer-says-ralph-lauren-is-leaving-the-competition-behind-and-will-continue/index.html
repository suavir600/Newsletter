      <li>Cramer made some positive comments about the company stock, as he said: “In a year that’s been very tricky for most apparel stocks, Ralph Lauren… has been a phenomenal winner, up 33% for 2025, trouncing the S&amp;P 500… I recommended this thing after speaking with CEO Patrice Louvet in August of 2023… If you’re selling a winner because they promised 150 basis points of margin expansion over the three years instead of 200 basis points that you were looking for, I can’t do…</li>
<li>This one’s got a moat, and that’s something you’ve gotta think about.</li>
<li>Investors look for steady margin expansion… And two, that it’s got a moat.</li>
<li>What I care about is steady margin expansion, and that’s what Ralph Lauren told us we’ll get.</li>
<li>Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE: RL ) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently shared his thoughts on .</li>
<li>While we acknowledge the potential of RL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.</li>
<li>The rest of the longer-term guidance looks fine to me… Pixabay/Public Domain Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) designs and sells apparel, footwear, accessories, home products, and fragrances across multiple luxury and lifestyle brands.</li>
