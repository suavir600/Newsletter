      <li>We’re their largest customer in North America, we do C$740m ($536.1m) of business with Diageo.</li>
<li>&quot;Dump it out right now, don&#x27;t even keep it.</li>
<li>Don&#x27;t worry about the money you spent on it, dump it out.</li>
<li>“The people’s business is the LCBO; the people of Ontario own the LCBO.</li>
<li>It added Crown Royal would still be “mashed, distilled and aged in Canada”.</li>
<li>&quot;I promise you that Diageo will pay the price and they’re going to pay dearly.</li>
<li>You&#x27;re going to feel the pain in February when these people don&#x27;t have a paycheck.</li>
