      <li>Beyond management&#x27;s capital allocation strategy, American Express continues to grow, reporting record quarterly revenue of $17.9 billion for Q2 2025, up 9% year over year.</li>
<li>To demonstrate its rising dividend, Berkshire is expected to collect $479 million in dividends in 2025, or nearly 37% of its original investment.</li>
<li>Today, American Express pays a quarterly dividend of $0.82 per share, leading to a 1% annual yield.</li>
<li>Today, Disney pays a semi-annual $0.50 per share, which amounts to a 0.8% annual yield and a payout ratio of about 13.7%.</li>
<li>Quarterly net income dipped 4% to $2.9 billion as credit losses edged higher to $1.4 billion, but management reaffirmed full-year guidance for revenue growth of 8% to 10% and earnings per share (EPS) in the range of $15.</li>
<li>- Disney reinstated its dividend in 2023 after pausing it during the pandemic.</li>
<li>Berkshire&#x27;s original $1.3 billion purchase in 1995 has grown to a $47.6 billion position today without reinvesting any dividends.</li>
