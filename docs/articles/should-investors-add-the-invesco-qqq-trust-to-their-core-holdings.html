  <h1>Should Investors Add the Invesco QQQ Trust to Their Core Holdings?</h1>
  <ul>
<li>For comparison, the S&amp;P 500's technology weighting is around 34%, while tech makes up nearly 61% of the Invesco QQQ Trust's portfolio.</li>
<li>The top 10 of the S&amp;P 500 are also tech heavy, but the list is only about 38% of the portfolio.</li>
<li>Worse, the top 10 holdings in the Invesco QQQ Trust account for nearly 53% of the portfolio's assets.</li>
<li>Even a technology-focused ETF like The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund has an expense ratio of just 0.08%.</li>
<li>One interesting fact here is that the Invesco QQQ Trust's expense ratio is on the high side for an index ETF, at 0.20%.</li>
<li>To put some numbers on that, the expense ratio is 0.09% for the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF and 0.03% for the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF.</li>
<li>In this case, the index is the Nasdaq 100 index.</li>
