      <li>Eaton Accelerates Transformation of Building and Data Center Infrastructure With Autodesk to Deliver AI-Powered Digital Energy Twin and Software Tools - New Brightlayer capabilities revolutionize electrical system design</li>
<li>With digital transformation, electrification and the shift to distributed energy sources, building owners are adapting to a changing power landscape.</li>
<li>Together, Eaton and Autodesk are transforming building electrical systems into intelligent, data-driven ecosystems that continuously maximize functionality and unlock value for the future.</li>
<li>Utilizing data and insights from Eaton’s Brightlayer energy software, the Brightlayer Digital Energy Twin enables building and facility managers to simulate, monitor and optimize energy use and building performance.</li>
<li>&quot;Eaton and Autodesk are introducing new dynamic capabilities for the building and data center industries that will fundamentally change how electrical systems are designed, built and operated,&quot; said Justin Carron, direct</li>
<li>The Eaton digital energy twin technology mimics and predicts how a facility will operate under various conditions and provides analysis on the impact of potential infrastructure upgrades prior to implementation – helping</li>
<li>The collaboration leverages Eaton’s trusted energy management and optimization solutions with Autodesk Tandem® to simplify complex energy system simulations and optimize electrical system performance across commercial bu</li>
