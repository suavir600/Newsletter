      <li>A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate: 10-year free cash flow (FCF)</li>
<li>In this calculation we&#x27;ve used 10%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.561.</li>
<li>Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.</li>
<li>Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$186b÷ ( 1 + 10%)10= US$70b The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$129b.</li>
<li>In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (3.1%) to estimate future growth.</li>
<li>In the same way as with the 10-year &#x27;growth&#x27; period, we discount future cash flows to today&#x27;s value, using a cost of equity of 10%.</li>
<li>Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.</li>
