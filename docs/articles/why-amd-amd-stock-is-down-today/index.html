    <ul>
      <li>AMD is up 27.7% since the beginning of the year, but at $154.06 per share, it is still trading 16.5% below its 52-week high of $184.42 from August 2025.</li>
<li>The move is also supported by broader strength in the sector, as recent data showed global semiconductor sales hit $62.1 billion in July 2025, a 20.6% year-over-year increase.</li>
<li>`` AMD’s shares are very volatile and have had 23 moves greater than 5% over the last year.</li>
<li>Investors who bought $1,000 worth of AMD’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,056.</li>
<li>The previous big move we wrote about was 8 days ago when the stock gained 3.9% on the news that a strong outlook from software giant Oracle (ORCL) fueled optimism for companies exposed to artificial intelligence demand.</li>
<li>The surprise deal saw Nvidia invest $5 billion in Intel, and the two semiconductor giants teamed up to jointly develop new chips for both AI data centers and personal computers.</li>
<li>`` Shares of computer processor maker AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) fell 3% in the morning session after its key rivals, Nvidia and Intel, announced a major strategic collaboration, creating a formidable competitor in the chip space.</li>
    </ul>
