  <h1>Wall Street Analysts Believe Epam (EPAM) Could Rally 26.37%: Here's is How to Trade</h1>
  <ul>
<li>The mean price target of $214.14 indicates a 26.4% upside potential.</li>
<li>While the lowest estimate of $171.00 indicates a 0.9% increase from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 45.2% to reach $246.00.</li>
<li>Epam (EPAM) closed the last trading session at $169.46, gaining 7.3% over the past four weeks, but there could be plenty of upside left in the stock if short-term price targets set by Wall Street analysts are any guide.</li>
<li>The mean estimate comprises 14 short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $20.95.</li>
<li>Are you wondering why?</li>
<li>The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.</li>
<li>But, for EPAM, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside.</li>
</ul>
