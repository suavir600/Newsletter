      <li>That&#x27;s why analysts expect its revenue to only rise 9% in 2026 before jumping 79% to $95 million in 2027.</li>
<li>From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect its revenue to grow at a CAGR of 106% to $17.27 billion as it buys more GPUs and opens new data centers.</li>
<li>Navitas&#x27; revenue more than doubled in 2023, but rose just 5% in 2024 as it ended a deal with a key distributor over unsold products.</li>
<li>CoreWeave&#x27;s revenue skyrocketed from $16 million in 2022 to $1.92 billion in 2024 as the generative AI market exploded.</li>
<li>For 2025, analysts expect its revenue to decline 42% as ithe macro headwinds drive its core EV, solar, and industrial customers to right-size their inventories.</li>
<li>That&#x27;s up from just three data centers at the end of 2022.</li>
