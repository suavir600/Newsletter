    <ul>
      <li>Premium dominance : Apple is at 62% of premium sales in the first half of 2025, while Samsung is at 20%.</li>
<li>Macro frame : Phone market growth in 2025 is at 1%, but Apple could outgrow the industry if base demand sustains into the holidays.</li>
<li>Though it&#x27;s mostly a modest 2% lift from its FY25 estimate, it&#x27;s still a far better outcome than Wall Street anticipated.</li>
<li>Case in point: Apple stock has climbed 5% this past week ahead of the release, outpacing the S&amp;P 500’s 1.2% gain over the same period.</li>
<li>One of those suppliers, Luxshare Precision, was reportedly asked to raise its daily output by roughly 40%, while another supplier was told to boost production levels by at least 30%.</li>
<li>A lot’s riding on the iPhone 17 for Apple ( AAPL ) , but to be fair, things feel a lot different.</li>
<li>That essentially blurs the line between “value Android” and “entry iPhone,” just as demand for the iPhone 17 holds up into the launch weekend.</li>
    </ul>
