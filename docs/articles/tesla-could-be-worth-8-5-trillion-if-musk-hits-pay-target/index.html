    <ul>
      <li>Tesla (TSLA, Financials) may need to become an $8.5 trillion company over the next decade for Elon Musk to fully unlock his new $1 trillion compensation package, according to veteran tech analyst Gene Munster.</li>
<li>This article first appeared on GuruFocus.</li>
<li>The path to that kind of growth is far from certain.</li>
<li>Munster noted that much of Musk&#x27;s pay is tied to Tesla&#x27;s market value.</li>
<li>Another possibility is a deal linking Tesla with Musk&#x27;s AI startup, xAI.</li>
<li>That target would make Tesla worth more than twice Nvidia today and almost eight times its current size.</li>
<li>Musk has pitched Tesla as a robotics company, with its Optimus humanoid designed to perform basic human tasks.</li>
    </ul>
