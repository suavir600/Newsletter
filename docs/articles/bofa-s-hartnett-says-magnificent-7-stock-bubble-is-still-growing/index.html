<li>The S&amp;P 500 Info Tech Index has surged 56% from its low in April, with investors buying into every dip along the way.</li>
<li>Past stock bubbles typically ended with trailing price-to-earnings ratios of 58, with the benchmark of these stocks 29% above its 200-day moving average.</li>

<li>A BofA team led by Michael Hartnett studied 10 equity bubbles since the start of the previous century, finding that these periods of extreme overvaluation produced average trough-to-peak gains of 244%.</li>
