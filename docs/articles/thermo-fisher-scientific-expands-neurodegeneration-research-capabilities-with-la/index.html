      <li>Thermo Fisher Scientific Expands Neurodegeneration Research Capabilities with Launch of Olink® Target 48 Neurodegeneration Panel Targeted proteomics panel delivers absolute quantification of key and emerging biomarkers i</li>
<li>The Target 48 Neurodegeneration panel is the latest addition to Olink’s growing portfolio of multiplex disease panels with absolute quantification readouts.</li>
<li>Alongside the Olink® Target 48 Cytokine, Olink® Target 48 Immune Surveillance, and the semi-custom Olink® Flex platform, this solution helps create a powerful ecosystem for proteomics research.</li>
<li>This panel delivers simultaneous measurement of 41 key and emerging proteins for neurodegeneration research with absolute quantification and optimized for plasma measurement from as little as 1µL of sample.</li>
<li>&quot;The panel, designed in close collaboration with leading clinical researchers, offers absolute quantification of multiplex key biomarkers to monitor disease progression and therapeutic responses to power precision medici</li>
<li>An early access user, Charlotte Teunissen, professor in neurochemistry at the Department of Laboratory Medicine at Amsterdam University Medical Center, shared, &quot;The Target 48 Neurodegeneration panel is a critical tool th</li>
<li>With diseases such as Alzheimer’s, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s on the rise and clinical pipelines eager for translational biomarkers, researchers face a pressing need for scalable, reproducible and disease-relevan</li>
