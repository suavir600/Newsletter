  <h1>Baidu's Rising Costs Erode Profits: Can Future AI Gains Offset Strain?</h1>
  <ul>
<li>The broader AI market offers a powerful tailwind, with global spending projected to rise at a 35.9% compound annual growth rate through 2030, reaching $1.8 trillion, according to a Grand View Research report.</li>
<li>Microsoft MSFT is pouring massive capital into AI infrastructure, especially Azure data centers, committing over $80 billion in fiscal 2025, with costs expected to rise further in 2026.</li>
<li>In the second quarter of 2025, its cost of revenues climbed nearly 12% year over year as Baidu scaled AI Cloud infrastructure, while higher operating expenses further reduced operating leverage and EBITDA.</li>
<li>Free cash flow turned negative at RMB 4.7 billion, while revenues declined 4% year over year to RMB 32.7 billion.</li>
<li>By July, 64% of mobile searches already featured AI-generated content, reflecting strong user adoption even before monetization began.</li>
<li>The company has committed to invest over $85 billion in AI and cloud, driving up operating costs but fueling rapid Google Cloud growth.</li>
<li>Core online marketing, still Baidu’s largest revenue stream, dropped 15% year over year in the reported quarter, widening the gap between legacy advertising weakness and heavy AI investments.</li>
