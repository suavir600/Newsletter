  <h1>Analysis-ConocoPhillips' deep layoffs highlight need for capital discipline, analysts say</h1>
  <ul>
<li>Crude prices, which have fallen around 12% this year, are expected to decline again in 2026 as supply outpaces demand, according to the U.S.</li>
<li>Capital expenditures this year are expected to be between $12.3 billion and $12.6 billion, about 10% lower than ConocoPhillips and Marathon's pro forma capex last year.</li>
<li>By Sheila Dang and Arathy Somasekhar HOUSTON (Reuters) -ConocoPhillips must sharpen its focus on capital discipline and investment priorities in order to regain its competitiveness against peers as oil prices and revenue</li>
<li>"If you're cutting 25% of your workforce, that also tells me how inefficient things are," said Michael Alfaro, chief investment officer at Gallo Partners.</li>
<li>trade policy have contributed to a slump in crude prices, pushing down oil company earnings to their lowest since the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
<li>And after a string of acquisitions in recent years, including Marathon Oil for $22.5 billion last year, the company lost focus on controlling costs, CEO Ryan Lance told employees last week.</li>
<li>That meant it needed to cut costs elsewhere, he added.</li>
