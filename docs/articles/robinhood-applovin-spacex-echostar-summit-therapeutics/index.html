      <li>Now, next up, Echostar striking a $17 billion deal with Elon Musk&#x27;s SpaceX.</li>
<li>The space exploration company agreed to acquire wireless spectrum from Echostar for about $17 billion in cash and stock.</li>
<li>Well, let&#x27;s start with the S&amp;P 500&#x27;s soon to be members.</li>
<li>We&#x27;re watching Echostar, Summit therapeutics and new additions to the S&amp;P 500.</li>
<li>The drug has drawn scrutiny as a potential rival to the world&#x27;s top-selling cancer therapy and became a symbol of China&#x27;s biotech ambitions after Summit licensed it from Aso in a deal that could be worth $5 billion.</li>
<li>Now, time for some of today&#x27;s trending tickers.</li>
<li>Ramzan Karmali examines some of Monday&#x27;s trending tickers: Robinhood (HOOD), Applovin (APP), and EMCOR&#x27;s (EME) joining the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC), the SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) and EchoStar (SATS) deal, and Summit Therapeutics&#x27; (SMMT)</li>
