      <li>Apple shares are rising 3% in intraday trading Friday and have lost 2% of their value so far this year.</li>
<li>The iPhone 17 Pro is selling for $1,099, up $100 from the iPhone 16 Pro, with storage of 256 gigabytes, or double the previous model&#x27;s and a longer battery life.</li>
<li>Xu Kaicheng / VCG via Getty Images) Reaction to Apple&#x27;s iPhone 17 from Wall Street analysts has been mixed, with some saying the catalyst for shares will be AI upgrades.</li>
<li>The tech giant introduced the lineup earlier this month and opened them up for pre-orders, with the new phones including a thinner model, the iPhone Air, as well the more expensive iPhone 17 Pro, Pro Max, and iPhone Air and also new Apple Watch and AirPods models.</li>
<li>According to CNBC, demand is especially strong for the Pro and Pro Max models, with lines in London “notably longer” than they were for the iPhone 16 and consumers in Beijing queuing up the night before to get their hands on the models following strong pre-order sales in China.</li>
<li>Apple shares have struggled this year amid Wall Street consensus that its devices have been slow to catch up in the AI race.</li>
<li>Apple&#x27;s iPhone 17 lineup went on sale Friday, with early sales of the devices across the U.S, Europe and Asia reportedly drawing long lines amid strong demand—especially for the Pro models.</li>
