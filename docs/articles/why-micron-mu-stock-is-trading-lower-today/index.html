    <ul>
      <li>Micron is up 85.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $162.19 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $168.89 from September 2025.</li>
<li>Micron’s shares are very volatile and have had 27 moves greater than 5% over the last year.</li>
<li>Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Micron’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $3,300.</li>
<li>Demand was so robust that Micron&#x27;s HBM production for 2025 was already sold out, with a strong outlook extending into 2026.</li>
<li>Wolfe Research boosted its price target to $180, while UBS and Mizuho set even higher targets of $185 and $182, respectively.</li>
<li>The previous big move we wrote about was 1 day ago when the stock gained 5.4% on the news that a flurry of Wall Street analysts raised their price targets, citing immense demand for the company&#x27;s high-performance memory chips used in artificial intelligence.</li>
<li>Shares of memory chips maker Micron (NYSE:MU) fell 4.9% in the morning session after reports surfaced that competitor Samsung had its high-bandwidth memory (HBM3E) qualified by key customer NVIDIA, sparking concerns about increased competition and potential pricing pressure.</li>
    </ul>
