  <h1>Apple, Gold and Inflation: 3 Things to Watch</h1>
  <ul>
<li>I mean, the shares are down 4% this year, which I think ranked at about 300 and something within the S&amp;P 500.</li>
<li>So if the Fed was looking for a reason not to cut interest rates, it would potentially have one because its target is 2%.</li>
<li>And then in 2027, the 20th anniversary of the iPhone.</li>
<li>I think you've already flagged that there is some mild acceleration expected in the consumer price index rate to just under 3%.</li>
<li>But I'm sure yes, at some stage, given that Apple is spending barely 5% of its sales on capital investment, and most of its rivals are spending 15 to 20% or more, there may be some certainly questions asked as to what it</li>
<li>I'd be personally surprised by a 50 point cut, but you never can tell.</li>
<li>Yeah, the markets are convinced that we'll get at least a 25 basis point cut next week.</li>
</ul>
