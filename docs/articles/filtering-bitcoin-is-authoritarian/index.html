      <li>The Great Bitcoin Filter Debate of 2025 rages on, and it’s getting pretty brutal.</li>
<li>Despite 100% of users filtering transactions with extremely low fee rates, those transactions were still being mined in over half of the blocks.</li>
<li>In other words, even with 100% filtering we still see the iron laws of economics prevail: if there’s a paying customer, someone will cash the check.</li>
<li>One Bitcoin developer who goes by the online pseudonym “PortlandHODL” demonstrates that the number is upwards of 98% of all nodes to impose a modest cost.</li>
<li>Also called Bitcoin-NFTs, backlash against these Ordinals grew rapidly from there appearance in 2023 and a growing sect of Bitcoiners have advocated for “filtering” these Bitcoin transactions out of the blockchain.</li>
