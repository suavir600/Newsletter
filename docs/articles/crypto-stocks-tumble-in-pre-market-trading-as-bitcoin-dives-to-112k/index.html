      <li>Mara Holdings (MARA) and Metaplanet (TYO: 3350) also lost more than 3%.</li>
<li>Coinbase (COIN) is down by 3% in pre-market trading while Strategy (MSTR) slid by 2.3%.</li>
<li>The equities sell-off comes after a grueling weekly open for crypto markets during the Asia morning; BTC and ether (ETH) are down 2.3% and 6.4% respectively while several altcoins were dealt double-digit moves to the downside.</li>
<li>Crypto treasury companies had a rougher morning; with solana treasury company Forward Industries (FORD) selling off by as much as 5% in pre-market trading while ETH-focused BitMine (BMNR) lost 3.9%.</li>
<li>The move was a culmination of several tokens losing momentum after gaining ground last week alongside the Federal Reserve&#x27;s decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points.</li>
<li>The reversal led to widespread liquidations across crypto derivatives exchanges, with $500 million worth of ETH positions being unwound in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGlass .</li>
<li>Crypto-related company stocks tumbled in pre-market trading on Monday as bitcoin (BTC) and several altcoins succumbed to unrelenting sell pressure, spurring $1.6 billion in liquidations across derivatives exchanges.</li>
