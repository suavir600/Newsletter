      <li>ConocoPhillips also recently finished integrating Marathon Oil, which it agreed to acquire in 2024 for over $22 billion.</li>
<li>BP said in January it would cut 5% of its global workforce and later shared that layoffs would be higher in some departments.</li>
<li>- This comes after news earlier this year that Chevron is slashing 20% of its global workforce.</li>
<li>Dive Brief: - ConocoPhillips expects to cut between 20% and 25% of its global workforce, including contractors, a company spokesperson confirmed to C-Store Dive.</li>
<li>The energy company had about 11,800 employees in 14 countries at the end of 2024, according to its annual report.</li>
<li>“As part of this process, we have informed employees that a 20% to 25% reduction in our global workforce, which includes employees and contractors, is anticipated.” The average crude price in May was the lowest the U.S.</li>
