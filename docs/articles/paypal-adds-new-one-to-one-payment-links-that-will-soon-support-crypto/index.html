    <ul>
      <li>Personal payments remain exempt from 1099-K reporting, the company notes.</li>
<li>Any unclaimed links expire after 10 days, though users can send out a reminder or cancel the payment link at any time, if needed.</li>
<li>PayPal Me links were only used to get paid.</li>
<li>The feature will first be available to users in the U.S.</li>
<li>This link is private and is associated with just that transaction.</li>
<li>As a result, there are fewer steps involved, making the payments faster.</li>
<li>but will expand later this month to other markets, including the U.K., Italy, and elsewhere.</li>
    </ul>
