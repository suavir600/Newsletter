      <li>Revenues are projected to fall 7.6% year over year in fiscal 2025 before growing 1.5% in 2026.</li>
<li>Importantly, management raised its fiscal 2025 share repurchase target to $4.2–$4.4 billion, having already bought back $3.6 billion year to date, reducing outstanding shares by 9%.</li>
<li>The revised figures still imply an 18% earnings decline in fiscal 2025, but a 2.5% rebound in 2026.</li>
<li>For fiscal 2026, analysts expect a modest rebound with 2.5% EPS growth and 1.5% revenue improvement, aided by stabilization in housing demand and easing cost pressures.</li>
<li>Horton Revenues and EPS for fiscal 2025 are projected to decline 7.6% and 18%, respectively, reflecting pressure from affordability constraints, higher incentive spending, and slower absorption rates.</li>
<li>Gross margins are expected to dip to 21–21.5% in the fiscal fourth quarter as incentives rise to stimulate traffic.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, permits for future single-family construction inched up 0.5% to 870,000 units, ending a four-month decline.</li>
