  <h1>Oracle: Should Wall Street expect earnings to mirror Salesforce?</h1>
  <ul>
<li>Their backlog on the last quarter was 138 billion.</li>
<li>It's expected to be 149 billion on this upcoming first quarter.</li>
<li>That's their niche.</li>
<li>So, we'll see if that comes to fruition.</li>
<li>You look at Snowflake, you look at Salesforce.</li>
<li>And I believe that Oracle is more focused on infrastructure as a service.</li>
<li>If you think of Salesforce, they're really more software as a service, right?</li>
</ul>
