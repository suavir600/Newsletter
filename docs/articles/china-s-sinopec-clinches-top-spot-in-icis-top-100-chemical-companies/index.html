      <li>Look for Chinese chemical companies to continue moving up in the ICIS Top 100 rankings.</li>
<li>&quot;It&#x27;s been tough sledding with key profitability metrics in 2024 well off their peaks in 2021.</li>
<li>Sinopec has taken the top spot from Germany-based BASF which ranked second with $67.5 billion in revenues.</li>
<li>Most chemical producers around the world saw major profit declines in 2024, primarily driven by industry-wide overcapacity paired with weak demand, conditions that persist in 2025.</li>
<li>The slide is expected to continue in 2025, with overall sales also likely to take a hit in the coming years as a number of producers shut down or divest assets while being cautious on the M&amp;A front,&quot; said Joseph Chang, g</li>
<li>Rounding out the Top 5 are US-based ExxonMobil with $55.4 billion in chemical sales, US-based Dow with $43.0 billion and China-based PetroChina with $42.2 billion.</li>
<li>The ICIS Top 100 Chemical Companies issue of ICIS Chemical Business is available for download here Currency conversions to US dollars for the ranking are based on year-end 2024 exchange rates.</li>
