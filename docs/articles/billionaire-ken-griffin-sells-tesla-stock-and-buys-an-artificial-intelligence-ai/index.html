      <li>Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas estimates robotaxi revenue will reach $84 billion by 2035.</li>

<li>Musk says it will account for as much as 80% of the company&#x27;s value in the future, telling analysts earlier this year, &quot;Optimus has the potential to be north of $10 trillion in revenue.&quot; Tesla hopes to manufacture at least a million units annually within five years.</li>
<li>Indeed, Wall Street estimates Nvidia&#x27;s earnings will increase at 36% annually during the next three years.</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $651,345 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005...</li>
