  <h1>Is Medtronic’s 17% Rally Justified After Strong Earnings and Bullish Guidance?</h1>
  <ul>
<li>With a steady closing price of $94.03, the stock has edged up by 1.1% over both the past week and the last 30 days.</li>
<li>Analysts project the company’s free cash flow to rise steadily, reaching roughly $6.94 billion by 2028.</li>
<li>With the stock currently trading at $94.03, this represents a 3.2% discount to its underlying value according to the DCF analysis.</li>
<li>The bigger story, however, is a 17.2% rise year-to-date and a 7.8% bump over the past year.</li>
<li>Currently, Medtronic’s last twelve months free cash flow stands at $5.41 billion.</li>
<li>Over a ten-year view, longer-term estimates that are extrapolated beyond direct analyst forecasts suggest free cash flow could approach $8.94 billion by 2035.</li>
<li>Applying the two-stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, these projections yield an estimated intrinsic value of $97.18 per share.</li>
</ul>
