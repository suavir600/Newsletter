      <li>Its second-quarter revenue increased 22% year over year to $47.5 billion.</li>
<li>Assuming it can hit 20% revenue growth in 2026 and 2027, Meta&#x27;s top line could jump to $282 billion after two years (using 2025&#x27;s projected revenue of $196.1 billion as the base).</li>
<li>For comparison, the digital ad market is predicted to grow by almost 8% in 2025.</li>
<li>Grand View Research estimates that the digital ad market could generate $1.1 trillion in revenue in 2030.</li>
<li>That forecast points toward massive growth considering that Meta is expected to end 2025 with $196 billion in revenue.</li>
<li>That would be a huge improvement over last year&#x27;s revenue of $488 billion.</li>
<li>By 2035, the company estimates this figure to land between $460 billion and $1.4 trillion.</li>
