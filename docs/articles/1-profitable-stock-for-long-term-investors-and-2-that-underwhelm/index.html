    <ul>
      <li>Absence of organic revenue growth over the past two years suggests it may have to lean into acquisitions to drive its expansion Revenue base of $1.35 billion puts it at a disadvantage compared to larger competitors exhibiting economies of scale Estimated sales decline of 2.9% for the next 12 months implies a challenging demand environment At $51.15 per share, Haemonetics trades at 10.2x forward P/E.</li>
<li>Trailing 12-Month GAAP Operating Margin: 12.7% Formed through the merger of Strayer Education and Capella Education in 2018, Strategic Education (NASDAQ:STRA) is a career-focused higher education provider.</li>
<li>Trailing 12-Month GAAP Operating Margin: 26% Founded in 1997 by its longtime CEO Michael Hsing, Monolithic Power Systems (NASDAQ:MPWR) is an analog and mixed signal chipmaker that specializes in power management chips meant to minimize total energy consumption.</li>
<li>Trailing 12-Month GAAP Operating Margin: 17.5% With roots dating back to 1971 and a mission to improve blood-related healthcare, Haemonetics (NYSE:HAE) provides specialized medical devices and software for blood collection, processing, and management across plasma centers, blood banks, and hospitals.</li>
<li>Sluggish trends in its domestic students suggest customers aren’t adopting its solutions as quickly as the company hoped Performance over the past five years shows its incremental sales were much less profitable, as its earnings per share fell by 7.1% annually Low returns on capital reflect management’s struggle to allocate funds effectively Strategic Education is trading at $83.05 per share, or 13.7x forward P/E.</li>
<li>Annual revenue growth of 29.9% over the last five years was superb and indicates its market share increased during this cycle Strong free cash flow margin of 30.3% enables it to reinvest or return capital consistently, and its improved cash conversion implies it’s becoming a less capital-intensive business ROIC punches in at 45.9%, illustrating management’s expertise in identifying profitable investments</li>
<li>Why Are We Wary of HAE?</li>
