      <li>That comes on the heels of a blockbuster $67 billion issuance week and a projected $45$50 billion this week.</li>
<li>Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) is stepping into the bond market with a $2.5 billion multi-tranche offering as it works to finance its recent acquisition of Juniper Networks.</li>
<li>This article first appeared on GuruFocus.</li>
<li>This deal could mark a quiet inflection point for HPE&#x27;s balance sheet strategy.</li>
<li>Their timing might not be coincidentalHPE&#x27;s deal lands amid a surge of corporate issuance, with about 17 companies tapping the market on Monday alone.</li>
<li>According to people familiar with the matter, the four-part deal includes both fixed and floating-rate notes, with the longest five-year tranche initially guided at roughly 110 basis points over Treasuries.</li>
<li>With the Juniper acquisition in play, HPE appears to be leaning into a more network-centric future, one potentially more recurring and software-driven.</li>
