    <ul>
      <li>Apple posted $94 billion in revenue in its June earnings call, up 10% from last year.</li>
<li>Apple stock trades around $245 per share as of September 19, up about 3% on iPhone 17&#x27;s launch day.</li>
<li>iPhone sales alone jumped 13.5% to $44.6 billion.</li>
<li>The services business, which includes the App Store and iCloud, grew 13% to $27.4 billion.</li>
<li>Verizon offers up to $1,100 off with trade-ins.</li>
<li>If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple&quot; [2].</li>
<li>Based on Samsung and Google&#x27;s foldables, which cost up to $2,419, Apple&#x27;s version will likely start above $2,000.</li>
