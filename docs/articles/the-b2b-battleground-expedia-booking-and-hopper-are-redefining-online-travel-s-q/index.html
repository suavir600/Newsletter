      <li>Expedia’s advertising/media arm generated $182 million in Q2 2025 revenue, up 19% year-over-year.</li>
<li>“If you’re going to knock out 50% of your commission, you’re down to a 50% margin.</li>
<li>In the second quarter, Expedia’s B2B segment did $8.8 billion in gross bookings, 29% of the total.</li>
<li>For example, in the first quarter of 2025, Expedia’s adjusted EBITDA margin in B2B was 22.8% versus 11.1% in B2C.</li>
