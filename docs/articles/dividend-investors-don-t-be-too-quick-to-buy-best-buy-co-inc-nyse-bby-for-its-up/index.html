    <ul>
      <li>Based on the last year&#x27;s worth of payments, Best Buy stock has a trailing yield of around 5.0% on the current share price of US$75.87.</li>
<li>With that in mind, we&#x27;re discomforted by Best Buy&#x27;s 8.6% per annum decline in earnings in the past five years.</li>
<li>It paid out more than half (60%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.</li>
<li>Last year, Best Buy paid out 104% of its income as dividends, which is above a level that we&#x27;re comfortable with, especially if the company needs to reinvest in its business.</li>
<li>The company&#x27;s upcoming dividend is US$0.95 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$3.80 per share to shareholders.</li>
<li>Have Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?</li>
<li>(NYSE:BBY) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next two days.</li>
    </ul>
