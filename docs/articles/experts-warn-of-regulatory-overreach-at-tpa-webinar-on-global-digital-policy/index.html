      <li>Renaud Brossard , Vice President at the Montreal Economic Institute , highlighted similar trends in Canada: &quot;In a lot of cases, legislators and regulators like to look elsewhere for inspiration, and unfortunately, in our case, they look to Europe.&quot; He pointed to Canada&#x27;s proposed 3% Digital Services Tax , stating: &quot;It is very easy for Google to just increase prices by 3 percent and then pass on the cost to the consumer.</li>
<li>22, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Experts from the U.S., Canada, and Europe gathered virtually for a webinar hosted by the Taxpayers Protection Alliance (TPA) to discuss growing concerns over the global spread of heavy-handed digital regulations.</li>
<li>WASHINGTON , Sept.</li>
<li>It is exactly what happened to us.&quot; Brossard also criticized the Online News Act , which has led to news disappearing from Facebook, and Bill C-11 , which he called an attempt to &quot;make current technologies fit in old regulatory boxes.&quot; &quot;Who is asking for regulations?&quot; Brossard asked.</li>
<li>TPA logo (PRNewsfoto/Taxpayers Protection Alliance) Titled &quot;The Global Grip on Digital Freedom,&quot; the event focused on the consequences of regulatory frameworks like the EU&#x27;s Digital Markets Act (DMA) and Canada&#x27;s Digital Services Tax , and how these measures are impacting innovation, consumers, and small developers.</li>
<li>Not innovators, but instead, the incumbents.&quot; Graham Dufault of ACT | The App Association warned that regulations like the DMA hit small developers hardest: &quot;Its must-carry mandate defeats the purpose of app stores entirely,&quot; he said, adding that developers depend on platforms like Apple&#x27;s App Store to manage costs, build trust, and access global markets.</li>
<li>Mike Salem of the Consumer Choice Center (UK) emphasized the speed mismatch between tech and regulation: &quot;The problem with regulations is once you decide to regulate, we&#x27;ve already moved on.&quot; He argued that self-regulation often works better, citing Meta&#x27;s parental controls, and called the assumption that all consumers use Google &quot;a problematic view.&quot; David McGarry , TPA&#x27;s Research Director, added:</li>
