<li>PF-07248144 suppresses this abnormal gene activity and thereby supresses cancer growth.</li>
<li>15, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Australian biotechnology investment and commercialisation incubator, Oncology One Pty Ltd, is pleased to report that PF-07248144, Pfizer Inc's clinical drug candidate discovered from Oncology One</li>

<li>The KATSIS-1 trial will have a broad international footprint, seeking to enrol up to 400 subjects across many trial sites including Australian hospitals and specialty breast cancer units.</li>
<li>MELBOURNE, Australia, Sept.</li>
<li>In certain cancers, KAT6A/B gene activity is dysregulated promoting cancer cell growth.</li>
<li>Although early detection has dramatically improved the overall survival rate of breast cancer, it is estimated that 10,000 – 12,000 Australians are currently living with metastatic disease.</li>
