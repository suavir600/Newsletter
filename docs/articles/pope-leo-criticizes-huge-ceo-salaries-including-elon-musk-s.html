  <h1>Pope Leo criticizes huge CEO salaries, including Elon Musk's</h1>
  <ul>
<li>Leo, who was elected on May 8, is the first pope to ever be born in the United States.</li>
<li>While Tesla's board might be happy with Elon Musk's proposed pay package that could see the billionaire receive $1 trillion , Pope Leo said he is not.</li>
<li>I’ve always tried to stay up on the news, but the role of pope is certainly new to me.</li>
<li>"What does that mean and what’s that about?</li>
<li>"I’ve followed current affairs for many, many years.</li>
<li>"Those things are all new to me in any sense of hands-on," he said.</li>
<li>I’m learning a lot and feeling very challenged, but not overwhelmed."</li>
</ul>
