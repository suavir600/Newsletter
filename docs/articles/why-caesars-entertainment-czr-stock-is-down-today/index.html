    <ul>
      <li>Caesars Entertainment is down 20.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $25.84 per share, it is trading 43.3% below its 52-week high of $45.55 from October 2024.</li>
<li>What Is The Market Telling Us Caesars Entertainment’s shares are very volatile and have had 20 moves greater than 5% over the last year.</li>
<li>The previous big move we wrote about was 6 days ago when the stock dropped 3.1% on the news that the major indices continued to retreat (Nasdaq -1.5%, S&amp;P 500 -1.2%) amid profit-taking and renewed concerns about tariffs.</li>
<li>Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Caesars Entertainment’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $517.37.</li>
<li>Rising Treasury yields added to the pressure, with the 10-year climbing above 4.2% and the 30-year nearing 5%, intensifying worries about stretched equity valuations.</li>
<li>Shares of hotel and casino entertainment company Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) fell 1.5% in the morning session after S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices announced that the company will be removed from the S&amp;P 500 index.</li>
<li>The company will be replaced in the S&amp;P 500 by online brokerage Robinhood Markets (HOOD).</li>
