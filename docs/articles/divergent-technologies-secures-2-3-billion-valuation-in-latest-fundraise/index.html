      <li>The funding round includes $250 million in equity and $40 million in debt, led by Rochefort Asset Management.</li>
<li>-Divergent Technologies said on Monday it has raised $290 million at a valuation of $2.3 billion, as the additive manufacturing startup scales up to meet growing demand from defense customers.</li>
<li>Earlier this year, RTX&#x27;s Pratt &amp; Whitney said it had developed an additive manufacturing repair process for its geared turbofan (GTF) engine components, which would reduce process time by more than 60%.</li>
<li>(Reporting by Utkarsh Shetti in Bengaluru; Editing by Tasim Zahid)</li>

<li>Divergent designs and builds hardware that essentially enables customers to 3D-print and assemble parts.</li>
