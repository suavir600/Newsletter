  <h1>Anthropic endorses California’s AI safety bill, SB 53</h1>
  <ul>
<li>OpenAI’s former head of policy research, Miles Brundage, said in a post on X that Lehane’s letter was “filled with misleading garbage about SB 53 and AI policy generally.” Notably, SB 53 aims to solely regulate the world</li>
<li>Most AI labs already have some version of the internal safety policy that SB 53 requires.</li>
<li>Despite the criticism, policy experts say SB 53 is a more modest approach than previous AI safety bills.</li>
<li>SB 53 aims to set these requirements as state law, with financial repercussions if an AI lab fails to comply.</li>
<li>Governor Gavin Newsom has stayed silent on the bill so far, although he vetoed Senator Weiner’s last AI safety bill, SB 1047.</li>
<li>“We have long said we would prefer a federal standard,” said Clark.</li>
<li>OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic regularly publish safety reports for their models.</li>
