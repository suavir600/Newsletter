  <h1>Why SolarEdge (SEDG) Shares Are Plunging Today</h1>
  <ul>
<li>SolarEdge is up 116% since the beginning of the year, and at $32.03 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $34.42 from September 2025.</li>
<li>What Is The Market Telling Us SolarEdge’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 96 moves greater than 5% over the last year.</li>
<li>The previous big move we wrote about was 6 days ago when the stock dropped 7.3% as the major indices continued to retreat (Nasdaq -1.5%, S&amp;P 500 -1.2%) amid profit-taking and renewed concerns about tariffs.</li>
<li>Investors who bought $1,000 worth of SolarEdge’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $169.43.</li>
<li>Shares of solar power systems company SolarEdge (NASDAQ:SEDG) fell 5.8% in the morning session after key competitor Enphase Energy (ENPH) announced the U.S.</li>
<li>Rising Treasury yields added to the pressure, with the 10-year climbing above 4.2% and the 30-year nearing 5%, intensifying worries about stretched equity valuations.</li>
<li>What Happened?</li>
