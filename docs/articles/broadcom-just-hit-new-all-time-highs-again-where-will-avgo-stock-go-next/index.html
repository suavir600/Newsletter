    <ul>
      <li>The chip-and-software giant generated $16 billion in revenue, up 22% year-over-year (YoY) and just ahead of Wall Street’s call.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA surged 30% annually to hit $10.7 billion, while non-GAAP EPS rose to $1.69, just enough to keep bulls fired up.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, the Street-high target of $415.56 signals the stock could climb as much as 13% from here.</li>
<li>The average price target of $365.19 suggests a potential decline of less than 1% from current levels.</li>
<li>Broadcom sweetens the deal with consistent dividend payments, delivering a forward annual dividend of $2.36 per share, yielding 0.82%.</li>
<li>Broadcom’s Q2 2025 earnings, dropped on Sept.</li>
<li>Over the past three months alone, AVGO surged 46.7%, notching 24 new highs along the way.</li>
    </ul>
