      <li>By 2030, agentic commerce could drive up to $17.5 trillion in commerce, according to Deloitte, which says agentic AI will be a &quot;pivotal force&quot; in the future of payments and consumer engagement.</li>
<li>Like any new technology impacting the customer, banks must develop a clear roadmap for adopting agentic commerce.&quot; For banks, agentic AI can lower operational costs by 20%, McKinsey senior partners Pradip Patiath and Ido Segev wrote in American Banker .</li>
<li>Large payment companies are speeding up agentic AI projects, putting pressure on banks to keep up.</li>
<li>If that&#x27;s not enough, agentic AI could also cut into revenues and profit margins,&quot; Patiath and Segav wrote.</li>
<li>Google recruited more than 60 companies to write the protocol, including Adyen, Alipay, American Express, Mastercard, PayPal and Worldpay.</li>
<li>28 (Black Friday), all Mastercard cardholders will be enabled for Mastercard Agent Pay in the U.S., with global deployment coming shortly after.</li>
