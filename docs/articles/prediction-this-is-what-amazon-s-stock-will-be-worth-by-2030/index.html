    <ul>
      <li>If Amazon can continue growing its operating profits by 20% through 2030, that indicates $210 billion in operating profits by the end of 2030.</li>
<li>In Q2, Amazon&#x27;s operating profits increased by 31%.</li>
<li>In Q2, ad services revenue rose 23% year over year, making it the fastest-growing division within Amazon.</li>
<li>That&#x27;s a 172% increase from today&#x27;s levels.</li>
<li>To account for some conservatism, we will use a 20% growth rate.</li>
<li>In Q2, Amazon&#x27;s North American commerce divisions generated $7.5 billion in operating profit on sales of $100 billion.</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $647,425 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005...</li>
