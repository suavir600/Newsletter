    <ul>
      <li>In 2024, nearly a third of Intel’s revenue came from China; Lenovo alone accounted for 12%.</li>
<li>While America’s chip manufacturing share collapsed from nearly 40% in 1990 to under 12% today (and zero share in advanced semiconductor chips, with Taiwan having more than 60 percent share of the world market and 90% of advanced chips, Intel poured resources into at least 43 Chinese artificial intelligence and semiconductor startups , more than any other U.S.</li>
<li>Granted $19.5 billion through America’s CHIPS and Science Act —funds meant to restore U.S.</li>
<li>And I should know, because I personally played a pivotal role in bringing to light the crisis that led to the unprecedented nationalization of 9.9% stake in America’s chips champion.</li>
<li>Worse, Intel funneled $1.5 billion into Tsinghua University —China’s “MIT,” tightly bound to the People’s Liberation Army and Communist Party, counting none other than Chairman Xi as an alumnus.</li>
<li>A Reuters investigation with Future Union found Lip-Bu Tan’s minority investments in over 600 Chinese startups between 2012 and 2024—including dozens with direct PLA ties—while on Intel’s board.</li>
<li>But instead of rebuilding at home, Intel doubled down on China.</li>
    </ul>
