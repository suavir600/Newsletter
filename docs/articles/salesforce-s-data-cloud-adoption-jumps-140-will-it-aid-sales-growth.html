  <h1>Salesforce's Data Cloud Adoption Jumps 140%: Will It Aid Sales Growth?</h1>
  <ul>
<li>CRM recently delivered another strong set of financial results, with revenues rising 10% year over year to $10.25 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2026.</li>
<li>In the first and second quarters, total revenues rose 8% and 10%, respectively, year over year.</li>
<li>Salesforce estimates that its data-related business is already generating around $7 billion annually.</li>
<li>The Zacks Consensus Estimate depicts that this trend will persist, with high single-digit growth expected for fiscal 2026 and 2027.</li>
<li>One of the standout highlights for the reported quarter was the rapid growth of its Data Cloud business, which saw a 140% surge in customer count on a year-over-year basis.</li>
<li>After years of consistent double-digit revenue increases, the momentum has faded.</li>
