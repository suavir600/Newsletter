    <ul>
      <li>The Motley Fool recommends the following options: short November 2025 $21 puts on Intel.</li>
<li>The company invested more than $25 billion in capital expenses for fiscal years 2022 and 2023, followed by $24.9 billion in 2024.</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $651,345 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005...</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,080,327 !* Now, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,058 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 189% for the S&amp;P 500.</li>
<li>Consider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004...</li>
<li>Most of Intel&#x27;s debt was finalized before the inflation crisis of 2022, so the loan terms aren&#x27;t terrible.</li>
<li>Nvidia&#x27;s additional investment supports Intel&#x27;s infrastructure buildout, at the cost of approximately 3.4% stock dilution.</li>
    </ul>
