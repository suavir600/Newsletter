    <ul>
      <li>The market was valued at approximately $7.4 billion in 2024 and is projected to more than double that —$15.4 billion—by 2032.</li>
<li>Cold foam sales grew 23% year-over-year, the company reported during its Q3 earnings call in July , making it a natural vehicle for protein enhancement.</li>
<li>Consumer interest in protein has surged, with protein mentions on social media platforms increasing by more than 10% year-over-year.</li>
<li>In a recent poll, 11% of millennials and nearly as many from Gen Z reported following a gluten-free diet, despite only 1% of Americans being diagnosed with celiac disease.</li>
<li>The global high-protein food market is projected to grow by $50.2 billion by 2028, according to research firm Technavio , driven by increasing health consciousness and of fitness culture’s popularity.</li>
<li>Since taking over as CEO in September 2024, Niccol has implemented sweeping changes designed to improve the customer experience and reverse declining sales.</li>
<li>And while Starbucks is streamlining its menu by cutting 30% of offerings by the end of the year, it’s still testing new items through its “Starting Five” program at select locations before national rollout, including the aforementioned protein cold foam, freshly baked croissants, and layered Frappuccinos.</li>
