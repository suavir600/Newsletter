    <ul>
      <li>The second quarter of 2025 saw Omega invest in new assets, which should help spur growth and post an 8% year-over-year increase in adjusted funds from operations (FFO).</li>
<li>Pfizer cut its dividend in 2009 when it bought Wyeth.</li>
<li>Right now, the yield is around 3% or so, the lowest on this list.</li>
<li>Why pick Merck and its less impressive, though still high, 4% yield?</li>
<li>If you were looking only at yield, you might rush out to buy Pfizer and its 7.2% dividend yield right now.</li>
<li>That should make Omega&#x27;s nearly 6.4% yield look a lot more attractive, even for more conservative dividend investors.</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $651,345 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005...</li>
    </ul>
