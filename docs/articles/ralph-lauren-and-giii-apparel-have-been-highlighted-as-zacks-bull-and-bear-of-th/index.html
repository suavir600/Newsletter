    <ul>
      <li>GIII now expects annual sales to dip 5% to $3.02 billion, with adjusted EPS projected to drop to between $2.53-$2.73 in its current fiscal 2026 from $4.42 per share in FY25.</li>
<li>Plus, FY27 EPS is projected to rise another 9% to $16.08.</li>
<li>Focusing on high-margin, luxury offerings that resonate with affluent consumers (premiumization), Ralph Lauren&#x27;s total sales are expected to be up 6% in its current fiscal 2026 and are projected to increase another 5% in FY27 to what would be an all-time high of $7.87 billion.</li>
<li>Ralph Lauren&#x27;s annual earnings are now forecasted to spike another 20% in FY26 to $14.77 per share, versus a previous EPS peak of $12.33 in FY25.</li>
<li>More exhilarating, in the last 60 days, FY26 and FY27 EPS estimates have risen over 7% respectively.</li>
<li>Attributed to its weaker and cautious outlook, FY25 EPS revisions have fallen 6% in the last 30 days.</li>
<li>As part of the deal, NVIDIA will acquire Intel shares at $23.28 each, reflecting a 6.5% discount to INTC&#x27;s closing price on Wednesday.</li>
