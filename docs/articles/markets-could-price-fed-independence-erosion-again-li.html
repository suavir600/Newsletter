  <h1>Markets Could Price Fed Independence Erosion Again: Li</h1>
  <ul>
<li>Li speaks on Bloomberg Television.</li>
<li>BlackRock's Wei Li says the cooling down of the US jobs market creates "enough macro justification for the Fed to go ahead with near-term rate cuts" without the central bank's independence being brought into question.</li>
<li>She also adds that markets could start to price back in some of the "previous independence erosion premia," which can have a positive effect on equities and bonds.</li>
</ul>
