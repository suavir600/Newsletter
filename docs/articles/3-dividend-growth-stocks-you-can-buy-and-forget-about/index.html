    <ul>
      <li>These stocks offer seemingly low yields of less than 1%.</li>
<li>But shares of Walmart have skyrocketed more than 120% over the past five years.</li>
<li>That&#x27;s below the S&amp;P 500 average of 1.2%, which already isn&#x27;t all that high to begin with.</li>
<li>Even despite such significant increases to the dividend, the stock&#x27;s payout ratio is less than 40%.</li>
<li>Earlier this year, the big-box chain announced it was raising its dividend by a generous rate of 13%.</li>
<li>At less than 0.7%, this is another seemingly unimpressive dividend stock that is better than it looks.</li>
<li>Walmart is a top retail stock to own, but its dividend may not be all that exciting as it yields just 0.9%.</li>
    </ul>
