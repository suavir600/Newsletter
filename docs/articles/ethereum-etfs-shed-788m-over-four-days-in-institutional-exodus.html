  <h1>Ethereum ETFs Shed $788M Over Four Days in Institutional Exodus</h1>
  <ul>
<li>Ethereum is currently trading at $4,304, flat on the day and down 3.3% over the past week, according to CoinGecko.</li>
<li>In comparison, Bitcoin trades at $111,811, up 0.5% in the last day and 2.1% in the last seven days, pointing to its relative outperformance during the turbulent period.</li>
<li>8% of Ethereum Supply Now Sitting in ETFs or Company Reserves “I think the speed of ETH spot ETFs outflow is as telling as its size,” Konstantin Anissimov, Global CEO of Currency.com, told Decrypt.</li>
<li>Ethereum Whales Stacking ETH, Hinting at Further Upside The ETF retreat also contrasts with whale behavior, as large holders increased ETH positions by 14% over five months, according to Santiment data.</li>
<li>The bloodletting culminated in Thursday's $446.8 million exodus, the largest single-day outflow since August 4, according to Farside Investors.</li>
<li>The hemorrhaging marks a complete about-face from August's $3.87 billion in Ethereum ETF inflows, which “dominated” institutional crypto flows.</li>
<li>BlackRock's ETHA posted mixed flows, recording $148.8 million in inflows on September 4 before reversing to $309.9 million in outflows the following day.</li>
