    <ul>
      <li>The result, the startup says, is up to double the processing speed and lowering, by as much as 75%, compute costs.</li>
<li>Blacksmith launched out of Y Combinator’s Winter 2024 batch and today has a team of 11.</li>
<li>The $10 million Series A closed in just 14 days, with Google Ventures doubling down after first backing Blacksmith’s $3.5 million seed in May.</li>
<li>The San Francisco–based startup hit $1 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in February with just four people — Jayaprakash, co-founders Aayush Shah and Aditya Maru, and a product designer.</li>
<li>Since then, revenue has reached $3.5 million ARR with more than 700 customers, supported by a team of eight, and the company is aiming to double that figure by year’s end, Jayaprakash told TechCrunch.</li>
<li>Blacksmith targets companies with teams of 500 engineers or more.</li>
<li>Founded in January 2024, Blacksmith was born from the experiences of its founders, who met at the University of Waterloo before building large-scale distributed systems at Faire and Cockroach Labs.</li>
    </ul>
