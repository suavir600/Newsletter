      <li>“As a brand that serves more than 90% of Americans every year, we recognize the responsibility we have to help safeguard our food systems for long-term vitality,” Cesar Piña, McDonald’s chief supply chain officer for Nor</li>
<li>McDonald’s said Monday it plans to invest $200 million over the next seven years to promote regenerative agriculture practices on cattle ranches.</li>
<li>McDonald’s said its investment will help accelerate regenerative grazing and water and wildlife conservation on ranches spanning 4 million acres in up to 38 states.</li>
<li>The foundation expects the first round of awards will be announced in January.</li>
<li>The company has also funded regenerative projects on potato farms in Canada and Europe.</li>
<li>That helps produce more grass with deeper roots, which take more carbon from the air to help improve soil.</li>
<li>The Chicago burger giant said the investment was its largest to date in support of regenerative agriculture in the U.S.</li>
