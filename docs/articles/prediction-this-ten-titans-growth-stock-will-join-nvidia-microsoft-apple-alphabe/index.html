      <li>Prediction: This &quot;Ten Titans&quot; Growth Stock Will Join Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Broadcom, and Meta Platforms in the $2 Trillion Club by 2030 Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) surged a mind-numbing 36% on Wednesday to</li>
<li>Now, there&#x27;s reason to believe it can surpass $2 trillion by 2030.</li>
<li>Broadcom and Meta Platforms are currently under $2 trillion but would surpass the threshold with gains of 16% or less.</li>
<li>So it&#x27;s not unreasonable to expect Oracle to surpass $2 trillion in market cap by 2030 -- again if it delivers on expectations.</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $640,916!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005...</li>
<li>9, Oracle projected Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) revenue to grow from $18 billion in its current fiscal year to $144 billion by fiscal 2030.</li>
<li>Oracle&#x27;s road to $2 trillion is defined, but the path is riddled with uncertainty If Oracle comes close to its fiscal 2030 OCI revenue target, it wouldn&#x27;t be surprising to see the stock at least double from here.</li>
