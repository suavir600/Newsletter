  <h1>CRCL: Circle Stock Downgraded to 'Sell' as USDH Threatens USDC</h1>
  <ul>
<li>Sep 8 - Circle Internet Group (CRCL) faces fresh pressure after Compass Point analyst Ed Engel cut his rating to Sell and lowered his price target to $96, a 28% drop.</li>
<li>He estimates Hyperliquid's incentive program could strip as much as $100 million from Circle's gross profit if customers migrate.</li>
<li>The downgrade indicates high risk, and it is more momentum-driven than execution-driven.</li>
<li>This article first appeared on GuruFocus.</li>
<li>Circle depends on fees tied to USDC market share, so sustained outflows would hit revenue and margins.</li>
<li>Engel says Hyperliquid's planned USDH stablecoin threatens to pull users and revenue from Circle's USDC.</li>
<li>Trading and filings will be monitored by market participants to detect evidence of impact early.</li>
