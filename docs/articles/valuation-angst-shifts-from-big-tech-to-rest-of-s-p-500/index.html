    <ul>
      <li>( GOOG , GOOGL ) has seen its P/E ratio fall by 7.9% in 2025 even as its shares have surged by 18%.</li>
<li>Ed Clissold, chief US strategist at Ned Davis Research, points out that since the low of the 2022 bear market, the S&amp;P 500 has climbed 83% while earnings are only up 16%.</li>
<li>Their shares have climbed roughly 15% this year, essentially matching the 15% growth in earnings per share.</li>
<li>The materials sector, largely comprised of chemicals manufacturers and miners, has climbed 9% this year while earnings have dropped 13%.</li>
<li>The S&amp;P 500 Information Technology index has surged 27%, a rate that looks more restrained when put up against the sector’s earnings growth of 26.9%.</li>
<li>And while the group’s P/E, at 43, is elevated relative to the market, its profit forecasts for growth of 20% in the coming 12 months may partly justify the price.</li>
<li>The industrials and consumer discretionary sectors, for instance, have seen their P/E ratios rise by 17% and 15% this year, significantly outpacing earnings growth for both sectors.</li>
