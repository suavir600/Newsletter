  <h1>iPhone 17 launches tomorrow, but the crypto community isn't buying</h1>
  <ul>
<li>“It’s 2025 and Apple hasn’t figured out that people want secure crypto storage built in.</li>
<li>Pricing chatter points to a starting range of around $799 for the base model and over $1,000 for the Pro.</li>
<li>In June 2018, Apple changed its App Store Review Guidelines to prohibit apps that mine cryptocurrency on-device.</li>
<li>Apple locks it down.</li>
<li>iPhone 17 doesn’t change that at all.” A Singapore-based developer, who goes by the handle Ravi K on Discord, was more blunt.</li>
<li>Apple will unveil the iPhone 17 lineup tomorrow, rolling out four sleek new models with thinner frames, sharper displays, and faster chips.</li>
<li>Apple banned that years ago.</li>
</ul>
