    <ul>
      <li>The company held a remarkable 94% market share in the GPU space in the second quarter, while its data center revenue surged 56% to $41.1 billion.</li>
<li>Broadcom is on track to generate only around $13 billion in AI chip revenue this fiscal year ending in October (estimated by taking 65% of its $20 billion AI revenue forecast), so the Oracle news is just a huge opportunity for the company moving forward.</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $647,425!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005...</li>
<li>The Motley Fool recommends Broadcom and recommends the following options: long January 2026 $395 calls on Microsoft and short January 2026 $405 calls on Microsoft.</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,071,739!* Now, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,056% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 189% for the S&amp;P 500.</li>
<li>Consider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004...</li>
<li>This growth also wasn&#x27;t only powered by GPUs, as its networking equipment sales nearly doubled to $7.3 billion.</li>
    </ul>
