      <li>Arab, meanwhile, had worked on the smart speaker with Poupardin and then later did a stint at Zenly, the social app maker that sold to Snap for $350 million in 2017 .</li>
<li>According to app intelligence firm Appfigures, Airbuds also has a 96% positive ratings sentiment over the last 30 days across 9,400-plus ratings.</li>
<li>On Wednesday, Airbuds is announcing its raise of $5 million in funding from early-stage venture capital firm Seven Seven Six, founded by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian.</li>
<li>This self-expression feature is key to the app’s traction, Poupardin believes, as around 30% of users now engage with the app’s features beyond just seeing what friends are streaming.</li>
<li>For example, you have to invite friends to see more than your top 3 artists in the recap.</li>
<li>To date, the startup has raised a total of $10 million from investors including a16z, SV Angel, Dream Machine, Nikita Bier, Antoine Martin, Uncommon, and Night Capital.</li>
<li>Image Credits: Airbuds The startup has seen over 15 million app downloads up to this point, and has 5 million monthly active users, 1.5 million of whom launch the app daily.</li>
