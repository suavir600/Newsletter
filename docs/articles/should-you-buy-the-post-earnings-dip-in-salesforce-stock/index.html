      <li>For Q2, revenue climbed about 10% year-over-year (YOY) to $10.2 billion, slightly above Wall Street’s consensus target of $10.14 billion.</li>
<li>Non-GAAP operating margin also increased to 34.3%, while adjusted EPS rose 13.7% YOY to $2.91, comfortably topping consensus estimates.</li>
<li>4, shares of the cloud software giant slid another 4.9% after Salesforce unveiled its fiscal 2026 second-quarter results the day prior.</li>
<li>The current remaining performance obligation, a key measure of future contracted revenue, reached $29.4 billion as of July 31, representing an 11% increase from the prior year.</li>
<li>By contrast, revenue from the Professional Services and Other segment declined 3% to $546 million, signaling ongoing weakness in the division as clients pulled back on consulting-related spending.</li>
<li>Breaking down the company’s revenue mix, Subscription and Support continued to serve as the backbone of the business, growing 11% annually to $9.7 billion and accounting for a massive 95% of overall sales.</li>
<li>Over the past year, Salesforce shares are up just 2.7%, whereas the broader S&amp;P 500 Index ($SPX) has surged 17.8% during the same period.</li>
