  <h1>Why Strategy Stock May Never Make It Into the S&P 500</h1>
  <ul>
<li>Strategy missed the cut for admission into the S&amp;P 500 Friday when three additions were announced— AppLovin Robinhood Markets and Emcor —and it could be tough for the big Bitcoin holder to be chosen.</li>
<li>The company looks more like an exchange-traded fund or closed-end fund than an operating company with ample recurring revenue and profits.</li>
<li>The company’s strategy is to issue equity—mostly common stock and some preferred—and buy Bitcoin, making it a giant repository of the cryptocurrency.</li>
