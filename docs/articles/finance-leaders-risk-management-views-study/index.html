      <li>In contrast, 64% of respondents believe that these processes provide little to no advantage.</li>
<li>The report is based on a survey of 273 US organisations, specifically targeting CFOs and senior finance leaders, conducted in Spring 2025.</li>
<li>The report highlights that 61% of finance leaders acknowledge a significant shift in the volume and complexity of risks over the past five years.</li>
<li>However, the frequency with which management communicates risk exposure to the board of directors varies, with 57% reporting top risks to the board.</li>
<li>Additional insights from the report indicate that nearly half (45%) of organisations have appointed a chief risk officer or a senior risk executive equivalent.</li>
<li>Only 27% of executives believe that their ERM process would aid in identifying and managing a significant risk event that could affect their organisation’s reputation and brand.</li>
<li>The report identifies competing priorities and insufficient resources (both at 41%) as the primary barriers, along with a perceived lack of value in risk management efforts (29%).</li>
