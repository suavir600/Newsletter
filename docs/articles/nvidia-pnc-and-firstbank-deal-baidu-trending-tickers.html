  <h1>Nvidia, PNC and FirstBank deal, Baidu: Trending Tickers</h1>
  <ul>
<li>Now, Baidu shares jumped nearly 13% in Hong Kong.</li>
<li>And next up, we got to talk about PNC, which is agreeing to acquire First Bank in a deal valued at $4.1 billion.</li>
<li>The firm saying that competition from so-called XPUs, those are chips being developed by the likes of Google, Meta, Amazon, that that could shave about $12 billion off of Nvidia's 2026 GPU sales.</li>
<li>120 branches, $26.7 billion in assets from First Bank, and it makes it the largest bank in Denver.</li>
<li>The new target is $200 per share and joining us with more is Yahoo Finance senior reporter, Ally Canal.</li>
<li>Now, City still sees Nvidia dominating this market with more than 85% market share, but does expect those XPUs to grow over time, especially as Google shifts to selling compute capacity to rivals like Meta and Open AI.</li>
