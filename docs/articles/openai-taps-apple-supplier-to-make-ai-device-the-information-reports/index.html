      <li>OpenAI bought hardware startup io Products, founded by former Apple designer Jony Ive, earlier this year in a $6.5 billion deal, underscoring its push to move beyond software into consumer hardware.</li>

<li>Luxshare and OpenAI did not immediately respond to Reuters&#x27; requests for comment.</li>
<li>The goal is to create an &quot;AI-native&quot; product, hardware designed from the ground up to work with AI models, rather than bolted onto existing platforms.</li>
<li>(Reuters) - OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) has signed a deal with Apple ( AAPL ) device assembler, Luxshare ( 002475.SZ ), to make a consumer device, the Information reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.</li>
<li>OpenAI has also approached China-based Goertek ( 002241.SZ ), a supplier that assembles AirPods, HomePods and Apple Watches, to provide components, including speaker modules, for its planned devices, the Information report said.</li>
<li>Luxshare, a major assembler of Apple&#x27;s iPhones and AirPods, would bring large-scale manufacturing capabilities to OpenAI&#x27;s effort.</li>
