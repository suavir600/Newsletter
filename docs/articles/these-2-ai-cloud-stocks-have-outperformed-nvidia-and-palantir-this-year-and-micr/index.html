      <li>Since the beginning of 2023, Nvidia is up 1,050%, while Palantir has jumped 2,360%, and was even higher before a recent pullback.</li>
<li>Nvidia is up 24%, while Palantir has gained 108%.</li>
<li>CoreWeave&#x27;s revenue jumped 206% in the second quarter to $1.21 billion, while Nebius posted 625% revenue growth in its second quarter to $105.1 million.</li>
<li>CoreWeave has jumped 144% from its IPO in late March.</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $640,916!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005...</li>
<li>Nebius stock soared on the news, jumping more than 40%, and the tailwinds were strong enough that it even lifted CoreWeave up more than 5%.</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,090,012!* Now, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,052% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 188% for the S&amp;P 500.</li>
