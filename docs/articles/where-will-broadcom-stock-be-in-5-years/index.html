      <li>In the first three quarters of fiscal 2025, revenue of $46 billion increased by 22%.</li>
<li>That infrastructure software business made up 43% of the company&#x27;s revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Aug.</li>
<li>Additionally, investors can expect more of the same, as the $17.4 billion in revenue projected for fiscal Q4 amounts to a 23% increase if that forecast holds.</li>
