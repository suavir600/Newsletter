    <ul>
      <li>This year, analysts expect Tesla&#x27;s sales to fall by around 5%.</li>
<li>Some analysts think that Tesla can become a $2 trillion business by the end of 2026.</li>
<li>According to this metric, Tesla trades at a 100% to 400% premium over the competition.</li>
<li>For comparison, Lucid and Rivian are expected to see sales grow by 61% and 6%, respectively.</li>
<li>Next year, analysts do expect positive growth to return for Tesla, with 20% sales growth expected.</li>
<li>Despite a difficult start to the year, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock is now up by double digits in 2025.</li>
<li>And the numbers speak for themselves: Nvidia: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you’d have $458,208 !* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $46,659 !* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $661,694 !* Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies , available when you join Stock Advisor , and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.</li>
