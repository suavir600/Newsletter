      <li>As of December, Musk held a roughly 13% stake in Tesla, according to LSEG data.</li>
<li>STORY: Tesla shares rose as much as 7.5% Monday morning after a regulatory filing showed that CEO Elon Musk bought nearly $1 billion worth of the electric-vehicle maker&#x27;s stock.</li>
<li>He has also threatened to build AI and robotics products outside of Tesla if he cannot get 25% voting power.</li>
<li>Earlier this month, Tesla&#x27;s board proposed a $1 trillion compensation plan for Musk, in a huge vote of confidence for Musk&#x27;s leadership from the board, even as the company stumbles amid heated competition and cooling EV</li>
<li>Musk has consistently demanded a bigger stake and increased voting power at Tesla.</li>
<li>Musk&#x27;s political activity and public clashes with President Donald Trump had stirred worries among investors about distractions and potential lost sales, which had weighed on the company&#x27;s stock this year.</li>
<li>On Friday, board chair Robyn Denholm dismissed concerns that Musk&#x27;s political activity had hurt sales and said the billionaire was back &quot;front and center&quot; at the company after several months at the White House.</li>
