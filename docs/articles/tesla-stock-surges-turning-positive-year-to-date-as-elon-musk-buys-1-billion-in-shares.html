  <h1>Tesla stock surges, turning positive year to date as Elon Musk buys $1 billion in shares</h1>
  <ul>
<li>The stock is up more than 70% since Musk officially left DC and subsequently paused a proposal for a third political party in the US.</li>
<li>"We estimate converting just 1% of the US labor force to humanoid is worth approximately $320bn or $100 per Tesla share," Jonas wrote last week.</li>
<li>Tesla (TSLA) stock rose 2% on Tuesday in premarket trading after wiping out its year-to-date losses on Monday following CEO Elon Musk's purchase of shares of the EV maker for the first time since 2020.</li>
<li>Tesla disclosed that Musk purchased 2.6 million shares, worth roughly $1 billion, on Friday.</li>
<li>The company also aims to lift its market cap to $8.5 trillion from roughly $1 trillion today.</li>
<li>The purchases came about a week after Tesla's board proposed a pay package for Musk worth almost $1 trillion.</li>
<li>Musk has said Tesla will eventually derive 80% of its value from robots that he claims will help humans with everyday tasks, from cooking dinner to walking the dog to babysitting.</li>
</ul>
