    <ul>
      <li>ZTS shares have lost 9.1% year to date compared with the industry’s 10.9% growth.</li>
<li>OA is a progressive joint disease that causes pain and mobility issues in cats, with up to 40% showing clinical signs, though only 18% are formally diagnosed.</li>
<li>Subject to a favorable outcome, the company anticipates making Portela commercially available in the EU in 2026.</li>
<li>Based on the CVMP’s recommendation, Zoetis expects the European regulatory body to communicate a final decision during the fourth quarter of 2025.</li>
<li>What an EU Nod for Portela Will Mean for ZTS?</li>
<li>While Solensia, approved in more than 40 countries, offers monthly pain relief, Portela (if approved) would provide a long-acting alternative with dosing required only once every three months.</li>
<li>Designed to provide up to three months of OA pain relief with a single injection, the therapy addresses a significant unmet need in feline care, where treatment options for chronic pain are limited.</li>
    </ul>
