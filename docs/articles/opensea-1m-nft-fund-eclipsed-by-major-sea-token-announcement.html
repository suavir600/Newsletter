  <h1>OpenSea $1M NFT Fund Eclipsed by Major SEA Token Announcement</h1>
  <ul>
<li>The marketplace purchased the pixelated character for 65 ETH, worth roughly $285,000 at the time of the transaction two weeks ago.</li>
<li>NFT marketplace OpenSea has launched a $1 million initiative to acquire and curate digital art, unveiling what it calls the Flagship Collection.</li>
<li>The company emphasized that it has no intention of flipping assets for profit.</li>
<li>The first acquisition in the collection is CryptoPunk #5273, part of the original Larva Labs series later acquired by Yuga Labs.</li>
<li>While a handful of external advisors may provide input, final authority rests with the committee.</li>
<li>The long-term goal is to build what OpenSea characterizes as a “living museum” of digital culture.</li>
<li>Committee members with financial interests in a project under review will be recused from decisions.</li>
</ul>
