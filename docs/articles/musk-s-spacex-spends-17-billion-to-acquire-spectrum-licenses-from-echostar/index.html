    <ul>
      <li>SpaceX will make approximately $2 billion in cash interest payments on EchoStar debt through November 2027.</li>
<li>The deal for EchoStar’s AWS-4 and H-block spectrum licenses includes up to $8.5 billion in cash and up to $8.5 billion in SpaceX stock.</li>
<li>Elon Musk’s SpaceX has reached a deal worth about $17 billion with EchoStar for spectrum licenses that it will use to beef up its Starlink satellite network.</li>
<li>Last month AT&amp;T said that it will spend $23 billion to acquire wireless spectrum licenses from EchoStar, a significant expansion of its low- and mid-band coverage networks.</li>
<li>EchoStar said Monday that it will use the transaction’s proceeds partly to pay down debt.</li>
<li>Current operations of Dish TV, Sling and Hughes will not be impacted by the deal, the company said.</li>
<li>SpaceX and EchoStar will enter into a long-term commercial agreement which will allow EchoStar’s Boost Mobile subscribers to access SpaceX’s next generation Starlink Direct to Cell service.</li>
