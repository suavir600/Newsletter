    <ul>
      <li>Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) briefly dipped 3% to $111,998 before stabilizing, while Solana, Algorand, and Avalanche all slid in sympathy.</li>
<li>Ether bore the brunt, tumbling as much as 9% to $4,075, as nearly half a billion dollars in bullish wagers on the token were flushed out, per Coinglass.</li>
<li>As of late Monday morning in London, Bitcoin was trading near $112,700 and Ether around $4,170.</li>
<li>More than 407,000 traders saw positions liquidated in just 24 hours, dragging total crypto market cap below $4 trillion, according to CoinGecko.</li>
<li>A swift and brutal unwinding of leveraged crypto positions torched over $1.5 billion in long bets Monday, triggering the largest liquidation event since March.</li>
<li>Bitcoin, by contrast, has gone quiet rangebound between $110,100 and $120,000 since early July, even as gold breaks record after record, touching $3,720 an ounce Monday.</li>
<li>But that momentum may be stalling.</li>
