  <h1>M&T Bank's (NYSE:MTB) investors will be pleased with their solid 141% return over the last five years</h1>
  <ul>
<li>This EPS growth is lower than the 16% average annual increase in the share price.</li>
<li>But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%.</li>
<li>Also pleasing for shareholders was the 11% gain in the last three months.</li>
<li>We should note here that the five-year TSR is more impressive, at 19% per year.</li>
<li>But this move may well have been assisted by the reasonably buoyant market (up 11% in 90 days).</li>
<li>During five years of share price growth, M&amp;T Bank achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 8.6% per year.</li>
<li>Long term M&amp;T Bank Corporation (NYSE:MTB) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 106% in five years.</li>
</ul>
