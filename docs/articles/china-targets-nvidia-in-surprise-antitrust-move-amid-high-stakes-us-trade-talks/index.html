    <ul>
      <li>Nvidia&#x27;s stock slipped about 2% in pre-market trading, with Texas Instruments also down by a similar margin, as US index futures gave back early gains.</li>
<li>Beijing had originally cleared Nvidia&#x27;s $7 billion Mellanox deal four years ago, but only on the condition that Chinese firms wouldn&#x27;t be shut out.</li>
<li>Regulators in Beijing said the company&#x27;s 2020 Mellanox acquisition ran afoul of anti-monopoly rules, a move landing squarely as US and Chinese officials press through their second day of tariff talks in Madrid.</li>
<li>The timing isn&#x27;t accidental.</li>

<li>China just pulled Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) deeper into the trade crossfire.</li>
