  <h1>PepsiCo CEO’s Tall Order: Win Over Investor Calling for Strategy Reset</h1>
  <ul>
<li>This year, PepsiCo’s share price is down around 2%.</li>
<li>Shares in the company’s main rival, Coca-Cola, are up around 10%.</li>
<li>The company’s market value has since dropped some 25%.</li>
<li>Laguarta was at the helm in 2023 when the company hit a $270-billion market valuation, when droves of pandemic-bound consumers were buying Doritos and Pepsi.</li>
<li>Coca-Cola undertook a similar refranchising effort, a yearslong and challenging process that ended in 2017.</li>
<li>Frito-Lay free fall PepsiCo’s food business, a strength for years, has flagged recently, with the unit’s sales growth weakening in every quarter since 2022.</li>
<li>Laguarta, 62 years old, now faces an activist investor with its own vision for the storied soda maker: slim down.</li>
</ul>
