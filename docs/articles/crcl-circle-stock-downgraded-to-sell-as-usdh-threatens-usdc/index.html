      <li>Sep 8 - Circle Internet Group (CRCL) faces fresh pressure after Compass Point analyst Ed Engel cut his rating to Sell and lowered his price target to $96, a 28% drop.</li>
<li>He estimates Hyperliquid&#x27;s incentive program could strip as much as $100 million from Circle&#x27;s gross profit if customers migrate.</li>
<li>The downgrade indicates high risk, and it is more momentum-driven than execution-driven.</li>
<li>This article first appeared on GuruFocus.</li>
<li>Circle depends on fees tied to USDC market share, so sustained outflows would hit revenue and margins.</li>
<li>Engel says Hyperliquid&#x27;s planned USDH stablecoin threatens to pull users and revenue from Circle&#x27;s USDC.</li>
<li>Trading and filings will be monitored by market participants to detect evidence of impact early.</li>
