    <ul>
      <li>Texas Instruments is down 5.2% since the beginning of the year, and at $177.15 per share, it is trading 19.9% below its 52-week high of $221.25 from July 2025.</li>
<li>What Is The Market Telling Us Texas Instruments’s shares are somewhat volatile and have had 14 moves greater than 5% over the last year.</li>
<li>Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Texas Instruments’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,260.</li>
<li>Shares of analog chip manufacturer Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) fell 2.7% in the morning session after China launched two investigations targeting the U.S.</li>
<li>The previous big move we wrote about was 11 days ago when the stock dropped 4.5% on the news that its Chief Financial Officer cautioned that the recovery in chip demand is not snapping back as strongly as some investors</li>
<li>The comments were made during a presentation at Citi&#x27;s 2025 Global Technology, Media and Telecommunications Conference, where the company noted a gradual recovery across its markets.</li>
<li>This cautious outlook from a key executive prompted a significant sell-off, with Texas Instruments leading losses among chipmakers in the Nasdaq 100 and weighing on the broader semiconductor industry.</li>
