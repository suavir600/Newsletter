      <li>Emerging markets like India, parts of Latin America and regions of the Middle East delivered double-digit or mid-single-digit growth in second-quarter 2025, driven by increasing consumption of both snacks and beverages.</li>
<li>PepsiCo’s Competitors: KO &amp; KDP in Focus Both The Coca-Cola Company KO and Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.</li>
<li>However, the question remains whether this emerging market growth is sustainable or more cyclical.</li>
<li>PepsiCo’s reliance on macro factors like inflation, tariffs and currency fluctuations adds another layer of unpredictability.</li>
<li>The profitability of international operations, once a weakness, has now turned into a strength, which bodes well for long-term resilience.</li>
<li>Coca-Cola continues to rely on emerging markets as a critical growth engine, with regions such as India, Africa and Southeast Asia driving strong volume and revenue expansion.</li>
<li>While the company benefits from a growing middle class in many markets, swings in affordability and consumer confidence can quickly impact demand.</li>
