  <h1>This tea shop and cafe is opening a second location in Milwaukee's Third Ward</h1>
  <ul>
<li>Mallett used the $10,000 prize as startup capital for the second location.</li>
<li>It'll be a scaled-down version of her flagship store, at 1819 N.</li>
<li>Mallett's second location — in the Third Ward’s Marshall Building, 207 E.</li>
<li>Modeling Ray Kroc's business acumen without the ruthlessness Mallett first opened HoneyBee Sage when she moved back home to Milwaukee in 2017.</li>
<li>“But I wanted — like the McDonald brothers — to keep the integrity of our practices and quality of our products." The 2016 movie is a docudrama about how Kroc forced the McDonald brothers out of their namesake hamburger</li>
<li>The Marshall Building did kind of fall in my lap,” she said.</li>
<li>The 500-square-foot space will offer a selection of grab-and-go items, including sandwiches, soups and salads.</li>
</ul>
