      <li>Here&#x27;s what the company&#x27;s sales look like over the past four quarters: Quarter Revenue Year-over-Year Change Q3 2024 $41.5 million 22% Q4 2024 $43.8 million 8% Q1 2025 $34.8 million 5% Q2 2025 $32.5 million (18%) Data so</li>
<li>In Q2, BigBear.ai&#x27;s gross margin fell to 25%, down from 27.8% a year earlier.</li>
<li>BigBear.ai&#x27;s sluggish revenue growth has been a big reason I haven&#x27;t been impressed with the company for a while, but things turned worse in Q2, when sales actually decreased by 18% from the year-ago quarter to $32.5 mil</li>
<li>BigBear.ai&#x27;s revenue fell 18% in the second quarter.</li>
<li>Its EBITDA loss widened in the quarter and gross margins fell to 25%.</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $648,369 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005...</li>
<li>The recent drop in sales led BigBear.ai&#x27;s management to cut its sales outlook for 2025 to about $132.4 million, down from its previous guidance of $170 million, both at the midpoint.</li>
    </ul>
