    <ul>
      <li>In the case of Ford Motor, it has a TSR of 115% for the last 5 years.</li>
<li>Over the last twelve months the stock price has risen a very respectable 10%.</li>
<li>A Different Perspective Ford Motor shareholders are up 19% for the year (even including dividends).</li>
<li>Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) share price is up 65% in the last five years, that&#x27;s less than the market return.</li>
<li>Ford Motor&#x27;s (NYSE:F) investors will be pleased with their solid 115% return over the last five years When you buy and hold a stock for the long term, you definitely want it to provide a positive return.</li>
<li>On the bright side, that&#x27;s still a gain, and it&#x27;s actually better than the average return of 17% over half a decade This could indicate that the company is winning over new investors, as it pursues its strategy.</li>
<li>But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average.</li>
