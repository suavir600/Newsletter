    <ul>
      <li>Cognizant Technology Solutions&#x27; revenue is actually up 6.3% over the last year.</li>
<li>The share price has dropped 13% in three months.</li>
<li>That falls noticeably short of the market return of around 20%.</li>
<li>With a low yield of 1.8% we doubt that the dividend influences the share price much.</li>
<li>Longer term investors have fared much better, since the share price is up 9.4% in three years.</li>
<li>On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 2% per year over half a decade.</li>
<li>During the unfortunate twelve months during which the Cognizant Technology Solutions share price fell, it actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 12%.</li>
    </ul>
