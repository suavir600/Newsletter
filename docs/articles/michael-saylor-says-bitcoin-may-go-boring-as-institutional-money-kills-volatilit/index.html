      <li>Saylor speaking on the Coin Stories podcast | Source: YouTube According to a report from Cryptonews , corporate Bitcoin treasuries reached a record 1.011 million BTC worth over $118 billion, representing approximately 5% of the circulating supply.</li>
<li>However, accumulation patterns have shifted dramatically from the aggressive buying sprees that characterized 2024.</li>
<li>Public companies added 415,000 BTC to treasuries in 2025, already surpassing the 325,000 BTC acquired throughout 2024.</li>
<li>Stride removes penalty clauses for 12.7% effective yields, targeting investors with higher risk tolerance and Bitcoin conviction.</li>
<li>Strike offers 8% dividends with conversion rights to common stock, while Strife provides 10% perpetual yields with senior liquidation preferences.</li>
<li>Using AI assistance, Strategy also developed this first-of-its-kind structure to compete with money market instruments while maintaining Bitcoin backing and 10% target yields.</li>
<li>Despite Strategy’s reduced accumulation, other companies stepped up purchases, cutting Strategy’s dominance in corporate holdings from 76% to 64% while maintaining overall growth momentum.</li>
