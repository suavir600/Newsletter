      <li>Recent reports show that iPhone sales in China have declined 6% year over year ahead of the iPhone 17 launch.</li>
<li>The Consensus Revenue Growth forecasts for Apple remained effectively unchanged, moving only marginally from 5.3% per annum to 5.4% per annum.</li>
<li>The Consensus Analyst Price Target remained effectively unchanged, moving only marginally from $236.19 to $240.69.</li>
<li>Apple&#x27;s consensus analyst price target saw only a slight uptick in the latest update, moving marginally from $236.19 to $240.69.</li>
<li>Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein remains particularly reserved, reiterating a $180 price target and pointing to a lack of meaningful near-term catalysts.</li>
<li>The Future P/E for Apple has risen slightly from 31.36x to 31.99x.</li>
