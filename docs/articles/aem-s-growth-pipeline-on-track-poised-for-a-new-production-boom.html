<li>The second quarter of 2025 saw further progress as drilling campaigns advanced key projects.</li>
<li>AEM also continued to work on a feasibility study at San Nicolas, with completion expected in late 2025.</li>
<li>It also advanced the development of the production levels at East Gouldie, with work in progress for the planned start-up in the second half of 2026.</li>
<li>At Hope Bay, drilling results at Patch 7 also suggest the potential for mineral resource expansion.</li>
<li>Newmont is pursuing several projects, including Tanami Expansion 2 in Australia, the Ahafo North expansion in Ghana and Cadia Panel Caves in Australia.</li>
<li>The Hope Bay project, with proven and probable mineral reserves of 3.4 million ounces, is expected to play a significant role in generating cash flow in the coming years.</li>
