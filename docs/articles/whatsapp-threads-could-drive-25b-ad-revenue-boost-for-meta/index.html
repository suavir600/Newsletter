      <li>Even without factoring in revenue from Meta AI, Barclays expects the new ad surfaces to allow the company to exceed consensus growth estimates of 16% and 15% in 2026 and 2027, respectively.</li>
<li>The bank also accounted for some cannibalization in 2026, as new inventory supply could pressure auction pricing.</li>
<li>The bank estimates “up to $6B and $19B of incremental ad revenue from WhatsApp and Threads in ’26 and ’27, respectively,” highlighting a potential $25 billion boost to Meta’s top line.</li>
<li>Unlike the Reels transition on Instagram/Facebook in ’22/’23, we don’t see usage shifting away from higher monetization surfaces; WhatsApp Status and Threads are 100% incremental,” the note said.</li>

<li>For WhatsApp and Threads, the bank assumed “half of that level in ’26 and parity in ’27” to quantify new inventory potential.</li>
<li>Barclays noted that WhatsApp Status ads “should light up a huge pool of inventory across the 1.5B+ DAUs over time,” though CPMs are expected to lag other Meta surfaces due to geographic mix and lower targeting signal.</li>
