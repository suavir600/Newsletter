    <ul>
      <li>It also commited all USDH revenue to Hyperliquid’s growth until $1 billion in total value locked (TVL) is reached, with Paxos capping its own share at 5% beyond $5 billion.</li>
<li>Paxos’ Version 2 pitch included a deep integration of USDH into PayPal and Venmo, zero-cost on/off-ramps, and a $20 million incentive plan.</li>
<li>The launch will include limited minting and redemption trials, capped at $800 per user, to test core functions before opening a USDH/USDC spot market and eventually unlocking full access.</li>
<li>Criticism emerged over the process itself.</li>
<li>Native Markets pitched a tightly integrated stablecoin strategy tailored to Hyperliquid.</li>
<li>- Paxos failed to gain traction despite a revised proposal offering deep PayPal integration, incentives, and capped revenue share.</li>
<li>Early endorsements from validator groups such as CMI Trading helped further solidify support.</li>
