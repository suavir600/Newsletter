  <h1>Intel Cuts 2025 Spending Target After Altera Sale to Silver Lake</h1>
  <ul>
<li>As part of Intel in the first half of 2025, Altera generated $816 million in revenue with a 55% gross margin and $356 million in operating expenses.</li>
<li>Intel said its 2026 expense target remains $16 billion.</li>
<li>government convert grants into a 10% equity stake in the company.</li>
<li>Intel (INTC, Financials) said Monday it has reduced its full-year 2025 adjusted operating expense target to $16.8 billion, down from $17 billion, to account for the separation of its programmable chip unit Altera.</li>
<li>According to a regulatory filing, Silver Lake's equity portion was about $3.3 billion.</li>
<li>The update follows the completion of a deal announced in April, when Intel agreed to sell a 51% stake in Altera to private equity firm Silver Lake.</li>
<li>The transaction, finalized September 12, valued the business at $8.75 billion, far below the nearly $17 billion Intel paid to acquire it a decade ago.</li>
