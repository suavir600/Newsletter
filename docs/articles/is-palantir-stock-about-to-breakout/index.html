    <ul>
      <li>Current-quarter earnings estimates are up more than 21%, while projections for next year have climbed 16.7%.</li>
<li>Sales are expected to surge 46% this year and another 33% in 2026, while earnings are projected to compound at an impressive 40.8% annually over the next three to five years.</li>
<li>A decisive move above $159 would confirm a breakout and likely pave the way for another leg higher.</li>
<li>On the other hand, a break below key support near $150 would suggest further downside risk, signaling that investors may want to wait for a better entry point.</li>
<li>Yet the growth outlook continues to justify bullish sentiment.</li>
<li>This steady trend in upward revisions has helped Palantir secure a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.</li>
<li>That skepticism, however, can become a tailwind, pushing shares even higher.</li>
    </ul>
