    <ul>
      <li>Intel shares (INTC) surged 22.77% on Thursday and posted their biggest single-day gain since 1987.</li>
<li>Nvidia shares (NVDA), meanwhile, gained 3.49%.</li>
<li>Nvidia said on Thursday that it would buy $5 billion worth of Intel’s common stock, becoming another major shareholder in the beleaguered company just weeks after the US government took a roughly 10% stake.</li>
<li>The tech giant, which makes artificial intelligence chips, will pay $23.28 per share, it said in a joint press release.</li>
<li>The purchase will give Nvidia around 4% or more of Intel after new shares are issued to complete the deal, Reuters reported.</li>
<li>Trump has said that he plans to impose 100% tariffs on imported semiconductors, excluding suppliers that have committed to building products in the United States.</li>
<li>Last month, US President Donald Trump and Intel announced that the government was making an $8.9 billion investment in Intel’s common stock, calling it “a Great American Company that has an even more incredible future.” “This is a great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL,” Trump wrote on Truth Social at the time.</li>
