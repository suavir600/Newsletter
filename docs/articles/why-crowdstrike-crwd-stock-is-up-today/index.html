    <ul>
      <li>CrowdStrike is up 41.4% since the beginning of the year, and at $491.10 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $514.10 from July 2025.</li>
<li>CrowdStrike also provided strong guidance for fiscal year 2027, projecting over 20% growth in net new ARR, which easily beat analysts&#x27; expectations of 14% growth.</li>
<li>At its Fal.Con 2025 conference, the company set a goal to reach $20 billion in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), a measure of high-quality, predictable revenue, by fiscal year 2036.</li>
<li>`` CrowdStrike’s shares are quite volatile and have had 18 moves greater than 5% over the last year.</li>
<li>This confluence of factors, including market highs heading into a historically weak September, led to a pullback, with the Nasdaq Composite shedding 1.15%.</li>
<li>The previous big move we wrote about was 20 days ago when the stock dropped 4% as markets pulled back with the decline concentrated in the tech space as investors engaged in profit-taking following a robust week that saw the S&amp;P 500 hit a new record.</li>
<li>`` Shares of cybersecurity platform provider CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) jumped 10.6% in the morning session after the company announced ambitious long-term revenue targets and new artificial intelligence initiatives during its investor briefing.</li>
