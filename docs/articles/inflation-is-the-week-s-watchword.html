  <h1>Inflation is the week's watchword</h1>
  <ul>
<li>Bond yields fell, and mortgage rates fell below 6.5%, the lowest level since fall 2024, which could give housing a boost.</li>
<li>Core PPI is expected at 2.8% year over year.</li>
<li>It should show a 3.3% year-over-year increase.</li>
<li>In the the late 1970s and early 1980s, it reached as high as 13.5%.</li>
<li>It hit 9%-plus during the post-pandemic recovery and forced the Fed to raise rates to curb it.</li>
<li>The consensus estimate is that the index will be up 2.9% year over year and 3.1% year over year when food and energy are taken out.</li>
<li>Here we stop to note that the year-over-year increases of both indexes would be higher than the Fed's target of 2% annual inflation.</li>
</ul>
