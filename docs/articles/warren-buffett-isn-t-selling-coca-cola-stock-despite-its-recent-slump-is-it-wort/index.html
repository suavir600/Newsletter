    <ul>
      <li>By 2022, the dividend had increased to $704 million.</li>
<li>That represents 11% of Berkshire&#x27;s entire stock holdings.</li>
<li>In 2023, he claimed to drink five Cokes a day, and said he would rather give up a year of his life than stop doing so.</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $647,425 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005...</li>
<li>Berkshire first bought Coca-Cola shares in 1988, and continued buying through 1994, at which point Buffett had invested $1.3 billion in the company.</li>
<li>Just over 30 years later, not only are his shares worth more than 21 times what he paid for them, he&#x27;ll rake in $816 million in dividend payments -- more than 60% of his initial investment -- this year alone.</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,071,739 !* Now, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,056 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 189% for the S&amp;P 500.</li>
