      <li>Bullion has rallied nearly 40% this year, and recently broke out a spell of range-bound trading to surpass an inflation-adjusted record.</li>
<li>Bloomberg reports: Bullion traded near $3,640 an ounce, after gaining for four consecutive weeks.</li>
<li>Traders see a quarter-point cut this week amid signs of labor market weakness, and some potential for reductions extending into next year.</li>
<li>Whether the central bank will challenge these bets is a key question for investors this week.</li>
<li>That expectation has driven Treasury yields to the lowest in months, weakened the greenback and supported gold.</li>
<li>Lower yields reduce the opportunity cost for holding the metal, while a weaker dollar makes it more affordable.</li>
<li>Persistent uncertainty over geopolitics and Trump’s tariff agenda, and concerted central bank buying have provided support.</li>
