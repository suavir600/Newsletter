    <ul>
      <li>Data center and AI revenue rose 4% year over year to $3.9 billion, and Intel highlighted that its Xeon 6776P is the host CPU in Nvidia&#x27;s latest DGX B300 systems.</li>
<li>The Motley Fool recommends the following options: short November 2025 $21 puts on Intel.</li>
<li>Intel rose more than 20% intraday, while Nvidia ticked higher as well.</li>
<li>Its second-quarter revenue was $12.9 billion, roughly flat year over year.</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $661,694 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005...</li>
<li>Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) gross margin declined to 27.5%, and GAAP earnings per share was a loss of $0.67, pressured by $1.9 billion of restructuring charges and other one-time items.</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,082,963 !* Now, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,067 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 189% for the S&amp;P 500.</li>
