      <li>The surge helped push Alphabet&#x27;s market cap past $3 trillion, with shares climbing 4% to around $252.</li>
<li>Alphabet&#x27;s stock has climbed nearly 30% year-to-date, outpacing the Nasdaq&#x27;s 15% gain.</li>
<li>That puts Google&#x27;s parent company in rarefied air alongside Nvidia ($4.3 trillion), Microsoft ($3.8 trillion), and Apple ($3.5 trillion).</li>
<li>ChatGPT commanded 60% of AI-related web traffic with nearly 6 billion monthly visits, almost 10 times Gemini&#x27;s numbers despite being integrated into Android devices and Google services used by 2 billion people.</li>
<li>Google Trends data shows global searches for Gemini overtook ChatGPT on September 12—the first time that&#x27;s happened since ChatGPT&#x27;s November 2022 debut.</li>
<li>Within two weeks of going viral in early September, Gemini hit #1 on both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store globally.</li>
<li>Before Nano Banana, Gemini pulled in about 13 million monthly downloads compared to ChatGPT&#x27;s 64 million, according to AppMagic.</li>
