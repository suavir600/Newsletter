    <ul>
      <li>The formula for ROE is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders&#x27; Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Hartford Insurance Group is: 19% = US$3.2b ÷ US$18b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025).</li>
<li>Hartford Insurance Group&#x27;s (NYSE:HIG) stock up by 3.8% over the past three months.</li>
<li>That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders&#x27; equity, the company generated $0.19 in profit.</li>
<li>Especially when compared to the industry average of 13% the company&#x27;s ROE looks pretty impressive.</li>
<li>Therefore, the company&#x27;s future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 18%.</li>
<li>This probably laid the ground for Hartford Insurance Group&#x27;s moderate 12% net income growth seen over the past five years.</li>
<li>Based on the latest analysts&#x27; estimates, we found that the company&#x27;s future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 17%.</li>
    </ul>
