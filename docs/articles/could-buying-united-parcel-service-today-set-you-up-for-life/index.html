      <li>UPS data by YCharts That said, UPS&#x27; stock has fallen 60% from the highs it reached in 2022.</li>
<li>To be fair, it has long been in the 70% to 80% range, so the payout ratio was never low.</li>
<li>UPS Payout Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts The dividend payout ratio is currently closing in on 100%.</li>
<li>The problem comes in when you consider the dividend, noting that the dividend yield is a very enticing 7.7%.</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $661,694 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005...</li>
<li>However, even if the dividend were cut by 50%, the yield would still be fairly attractive relative to the tiny 1.2% yield of the S&amp;P 500 index (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) .</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,082,963 !* Now, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,067 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 189% for the S&amp;P 500.</li>
