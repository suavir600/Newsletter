    <ul>
      <li>CoreWeave’s shares have slumped about 30% since its second earnings report on concerns over margin compression in the second half of 2025.</li>
<li>The firm now estimates the GPUaaS market could expand from just $3-4 billion today to as much as $300 billion by 2030, with CoreWeave among the key beneficiaries.</li>
<li>Outsourcing is accelerating faster than expected, with Oracle’s blowout $455 billion backlog and reports of a $17 billion Microsoft contract with rival Nebius.</li>
<li>CoreWeave had an agreement with Nvidia for $6.3 billion for master service, under which Nvidia agreed to buy unused capacity, further boosts visibility on demand.</li>
<li>The brokerage set a $180 price target on the stock, saying the company is well positioned as large cloud providers increasingly rent GPU clusters instead of building them in-house.</li>
<li>But the immediate upside from hyperscale demand is too strong to ignore.</li>
<li>CoreWeave’s software-light model is often misunderstood, analysts added.</li>
    </ul>
