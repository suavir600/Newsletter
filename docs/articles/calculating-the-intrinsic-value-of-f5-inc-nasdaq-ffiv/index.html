    <ul>
      <li>Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2035 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.3b× (1 + 3.1%) ÷ (8.1%– 3.1%) = US$26b Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = US$26b÷ ( 1 + 8.1%) 10 = US$12b The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$19b.</li>
<li>Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate: 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 2035 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.01b US$1.03b US$1.06b US$1.09b US$1.12b US$1.15b US$1.18b US$1.22b US$1.25b US$1.29b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x4 Analyst x4 Est @ 2.38% Est @ 2.59% Est @ 2.74% Est @ 2.84% Est @ 2.91% Est @ 2.96% Est @…</li>
<li>Compared to the current share price of US$329, the company appears about fair value at a 3.0% discount to where the stock price trades currently.</li>
<li>In this calculation we&#x27;ve used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.096.</li>
<li>We discount the terminal cash flows to today&#x27;s value at a cost of equity of 8.1%.</li>
<li>Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, F5 fair value estimate is US$339 Current share price of US$329 suggests F5 is potentially trading close to its fair value Analyst price target for FFIV is US$326 which is 3.9% below our fair value estimate How far off is F5, Inc.</li>
<li>The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 3.1%.</li>
