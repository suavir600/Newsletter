  <h1>Strategy Stock Drops on S&P 500 Snub. It’s Still a Buy, Analyst Says.</h1>
  <ul>
<li>While Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy posted a profit last quarter, clearing the final hurdle required for potential inclusion, it didn’t make the cut.</li>
<li>The decision won’t have come as a shock to seasoned investors, and it shouldn’t discourage those who have bet on the buzzy cryptocurrency company, argued Benchmark’s Mark Palmer, a longtime fan of the stock.</li>
<li>Shares of Strategy were falling Monday after the Bitcoin -treasury pioneer missed out on inclusion in the dashing hopes that would trigger a flow of investments from funds seeking to match the index’s performance.</li>
</ul>
