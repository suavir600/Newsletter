      <li>In November 2023, inDrive announced a venture and merger and acquisition arm to invest up to $100 million over the next few years.</li>
<li>In contrast, Uber added 8.02 million downloads, up 60.6%, while Ola gained 1.55 million, a 13.2% increase.</li>
<li>Data from Appfigures exclusively shared with TechCrunch shows that inDrive saw 1.07 million fewer downloads year-to-date compared to the same period in 2024 — a 22.6% decline.</li>
<li>The report also valued Kazakhstan’s tech ecosystem at $26 billion — an 18-fold jump since 2019 — suggesting a sharp rise in local startup formation, funding, and digital services.</li>
<li>Rapido emerged as the fastest-growing player, with 14.9 million additional downloads — an 80.9% surge.</li>
<li>Smit told TechCrunch that of that venture, about 30% has already been deployed on the super-app strategy.</li>
<li>Without sharing specifics, Smit said that the company has added 30% more dark stores in the country since August.</li>
