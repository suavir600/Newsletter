    <ul>
      <li>TD Cowen analyst Krish Sankar raised his price target on the stock to $180 from $150 while maintaining a Buy rating.</li>
<li>Rocha added that with Micron’s stock now close to $170, &quot;expectations into next week are high&quot; for the company’s upcoming earnings report.</li>
<li>Investing.com -- Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) stock declined 3.5% Friday after hitting an all-time high Thursday, as Samsung Electronics secured a critical qualification from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) for its 12-layer HBM3E memory chips.</li>
<li>The company has already been qualified by AMD and has shipped HBM3E 12-High chips to them.</li>
<li>Typically, this part of the cycle puts more emphasis on ASP trends as we do not expect much multiple expansion from here, but rather continued growth in book value.&quot; Similarly, Barclays analyst Tom O’Malley raised his price target to $175 from $140 while maintaining an Overweight rating on Micron shares.</li>
<li>Samsung has reportedly demonstrated 11 Gbps speeds, outpacing SK Hynix’s 10 Gbps, while Micron is struggling to meet these requirements.</li>
<li>Nvidia has requested suppliers to achieve HBM4 data transfer speeds exceeding 10 gigabits per second, significantly higher than the current industry standard of 8 Gbps.</li>
