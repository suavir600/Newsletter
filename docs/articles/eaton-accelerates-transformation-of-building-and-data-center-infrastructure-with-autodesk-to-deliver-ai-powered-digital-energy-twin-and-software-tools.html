<li>Eaton Accelerates Transformation of Building and Data Center Infrastructure With Autodesk to Deliver AI-Powered Digital Energy Twin and Software Tools - New Brightlayer capabilities revolutionize electrical system design</li>
<li>With digital transformation, electrification and the shift to distributed energy sources, building owners are adapting to a changing power landscape.</li>
<li>Together, Eaton and Autodesk are transforming building electrical systems into intelligent, data-driven ecosystems that continuously maximize functionality and unlock value for the future.</li>
<li>Utilizing data and insights from Eaton’s Brightlayer energy software, the Brightlayer Digital Energy Twin enables building and facility managers to simulate, monitor and optimize energy use and building performance.</li>
<li>"Eaton and Autodesk are introducing new dynamic capabilities for the building and data center industries that will fundamentally change how electrical systems are designed, built and operated," said Justin Carron, direct</li>
<li>The Eaton digital energy twin technology mimics and predicts how a facility will operate under various conditions and provides analysis on the impact of potential infrastructure upgrades prior to implementation – helping</li>
<li>The collaboration leverages Eaton’s trusted energy management and optimization solutions with Autodesk Tandem® to simplify complex energy system simulations and optimize electrical system performance across commercial bu</li>
