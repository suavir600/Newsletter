    <ul>
      <li>Despite the improvement, Lucid still lost $0.28 a share in Q2 2025.</li>
<li>For example, it delivered 38% more vehicles in the second quarter of 2025 than it did a year earlier.</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $651,345 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005...</li>
<li>That&#x27;s better than the $0.34 per-share loss in the same quarter of 2024, but the company continues to bleed red ink onto its financial statements, and badly.</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,080,327 !* Now, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,058 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 189% for the S&amp;P 500.</li>
<li>Consider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004...</li>
<li>The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.</li>
    </ul>
