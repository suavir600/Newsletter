    <ul>
      <li>The REIT raised its dividend payout by 10.5% earlier this year to an annualized $2.96 per share.</li>
<li>Net operating income from its senior housing segment shot up by 23.4% year over year during the second quarter.</li>
<li>The midpoint of the guided range implies a gain of 18% this year.</li>
<li>At recent prices, Welltower stock offers a measley 1.8% dividend yield, but the payout could rise quickly in the years ahead.</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $651,345 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005...</li>
<li>With FFO expected to climb to $5.10 per share at the midpoint of management&#x27;s guided range for 2025, there&#x27;s still plenty of room to increase the quarterly payout further.</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,080,327 !* Now, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,058 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 189% for the S&amp;P 500.</li>
