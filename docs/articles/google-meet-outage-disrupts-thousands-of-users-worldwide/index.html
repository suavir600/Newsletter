      <li>For example, in 2022, a Google Cloud failure shut down Solana&#x27;s block explorer and halted transactions throughout portions of the network.</li>
<li>Google Meet users reported a large outage on September 8, with disruptions increasing sharply in the past hour.</li>
<li>These things throw off entire launch timelines.&quot; Another founder, known as DeFiShark, wrote: &quot;Running a team across 5 time zones, and the one thing we all rely on breaks down?</li>
<li>Not ideal.</li>
<li>According to outage tracking site Downdetector, reports of issues with Google&#x27;s video-conferencing service had reached around 10,000 by late morning.</li>
<li>Many customers reported being unable to join meetings or experiencing unexpected call dropouts.</li>
<li>A user on X named Mal | unBanked (@unbankedgroup) mocked the interruption, advising followers to &quot;get up from your workstations and go touch the grass.&quot; He also suggested that people “buy some crypto while you are at it.</li>
