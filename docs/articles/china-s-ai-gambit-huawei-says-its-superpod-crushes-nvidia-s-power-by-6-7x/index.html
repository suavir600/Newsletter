    <ul>
      <li>By 2028, Huawei expects to roll out its 970 series, continuing a march toward hardware self-sufficiency.</li>
<li>Xu claimed the new Atlas 950 SuperPod could deliver up to 6.7x the compute power of Nvidia&#x27;s NVL144, leveraging density over node advantage.</li>
<li>Speaking Thursday, rotating chairman Eric Xu detailed a SuperPod design capable of linking up to 15,488 neural processors into a single system.</li>
<li>The pivot seems strategic: if the fabs aren&#x27;t available, scale up the system instead.</li>
<li>Despite having licenses, Nvidia has yet to ship H20s to China, citing the impact of government guidance.</li>
<li>Investors are responding.</li>
<li>The timing isn&#x27;t accidental.</li>
    </ul>
