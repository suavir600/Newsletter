  <h1>Tesla Could Be Worth $8.5 Trillion if Musk Hits Pay Target</h1>
  <ul>
<li>Tesla (TSLA, Financials) may need to become an $8.5 trillion company over the next decade for Elon Musk to fully unlock his new $1 trillion compensation package, according to veteran tech analyst Gene Munster.</li>
<li>This article first appeared on GuruFocus.</li>
<li>The path to that kind of growth is far from certain.</li>
<li>Munster noted that much of Musk's pay is tied to Tesla's market value.</li>
<li>Another possibility is a deal linking Tesla with Musk's AI startup, xAI.</li>
<li>That target would make Tesla worth more than twice Nvidia today and almost eight times its current size.</li>
<li>Musk has pitched Tesla as a robotics company, with its Optimus humanoid designed to perform basic human tasks.</li>
