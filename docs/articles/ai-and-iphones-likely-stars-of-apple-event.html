  <h1>AI and iPhones likely stars of Apple event</h1>
  <ul>
<li>Apple is set to unveil its iPhone 17 lineup on Tuesday, with enhanced artificial intelligence features expected to take center stage.</li>
<li>"I am afraid that Apple's incremental innovation approach with the iPhone 17 will start reaching its limits – especially for those who are hungry for more innovation," he added.</li>
<li>Apple is also reported to be partnering with Google to leverage its search and AI expertise.</li>
<li>Since China remains Apple's primary production hub, these trade policies directly impact costs.</li>
<li>Tuesday's main attraction should be the new iPhone models, headlined by an ultra-thin "Air" variant.</li>
<li>But the engineering demands of thin phones can make them more costly to produce and shrink battery space.</li>
<li>A super-thin iPhone could also lay the foundation for a foldable version of the smartphone, expected in the coming years.</li>
</ul>
