  <h1>What's the Average 401(k) Balance of the 'Upper Class'? Here's What Top Earners Have Stashed Away</h1>
  <ul>
<li>Don’t Miss: - Most advisors charge 1% AUM fees and miss critical tax moves — Range helps high earners keep more of their money.</li>
<li>The median balance was $188,000.</li>
<li>But here's the real question: how much have the wealthiest 20% actually managed to save in those accounts?</li>
<li>Vanguard's Upper-Income Snapshot According to Vanguard's 2025 How America Saves report, participants earning $150,000 or more had an average 401(k) balance of roughly $336,000.</li>
<li>median household income hovering around $74,000, that means a starting line of about $150,000 a year.</li>
<li>Still, $150,000 has become the shorthand for where "upper-class" status begins — and where savings habits really start to diverge.</li>
<li>A $336,000 balance may feel substantial, but for a household earning $200,000 a year, it represents only a year and a half of income.</li>
</ul>
