<li>The Zacks Consensus Estimate depicts that this trend will persist, with high single-digit growth expected for fiscal 2026 and 2027.</li>
<li>One of the standout highlights for the reported quarter was the rapid growth of its Data Cloud business, which saw a 140% surge in customer count on a year-over-year basis.</li>
<li>After years of consistent double-digit revenue increases, the momentum has faded.</li>
