      <li>Revenues were up 15%, better than expected.</li>
<li>Alphabet shares were up by more than 4% on Monday afternoon in Europe, after they had gained more than 30% since the beginning of the year.</li>
<li>Alphabet&#x27;s shares have continued to climb, pushing the tech company&#x27;s market capitalisation to a new level and the company value to more than $3 trillion (€2.55tr).</li>
<li>Other members include leader, Nvidia , which is valued at more than $4.2tr (€3.57tr), followed by Microsoft with an approximate $3.8tr (€3.23tr) market cap and Apple, worth $3.5tr (€3tr).</li>
<li>Google&#x27;s search business accounts for more than half of the company&#x27;s revenue.</li>
<li>This means that Alphabet, the parent company of Google , entered a small but elite club of tech giants, worth more than $3tr.</li>
<li>However, a US federal judge has ruled that it doesn’t have to sell either , though the company must share data with competitors.</li>
