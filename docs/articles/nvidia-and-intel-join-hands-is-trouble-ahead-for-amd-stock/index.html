    <ul>
      <li>Overall revenue rose 32% year-over-year to $7.7 billion, exceeding expectations.</li>
<li>AMD stock has already been under pressure, down roughly 15.3% from its recent 52-week high of $186.65.</li>
<li>The data center segment delivered $3.2 billion in sales, up 14% despite weakness in AI revenue, driven by continued strength in EPYC processors across cloud and enterprise workloads.</li>
<li>The company entered the second half of 2025 with multiple catalysts that could reaccelerate its growth.</li>
<li>While the development led to a 22.8% rally in Intel stock yesterday, it could bring trouble for AMD as two of its biggest competitors are now working together.</li>
<li>To strengthen the partnership, Nvidia will also invest $5 billion in Intel stock at $23.28 per share, which will require regulatory approval.</li>
<li>EPYC has now posted 33 straight quarters of market share gains.</li>
    </ul>
