    <ul>
      <li>The projected earnings growth and margin expansion lend credibility to the consensus price target of $364.67, which is approximately 16.64% higher than the current share price of $312.65.</li>
<li>Comparing recent performance, Zebra&#x27;s stock did not keep pace with the US Electronic industry, which saw a return of 41.5% over the past year.</li>
<li>Despite the company&#x27;s stock rising 8%, this movement aligns with broader market trends, as the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 hit record highs, led by strong tech stock performances.</li>
<li>While the short-term stock gain of 8% aligns with broader market trends, Zebra&#x27;s long-term total shareholder return of 25.7% over the past five years provides additional context for its consistent performance.</li>
