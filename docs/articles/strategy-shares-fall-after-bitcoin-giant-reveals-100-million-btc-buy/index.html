<li>Shares of leading Bitcoin treasury firm Strategy (MSTR) are down about 1.4% amid news the firm spent $100 million to acquire 850 Bitcoin last week at an average price of $117,344.</li>
<li>To make its latest purchase, the firm used around $19 million in proceeds from its STRF preferred stock offering, and more than $80 million in net proceeds from its existing $21 billion MSTR common stock offering.</li>
<li>Based on data from its Monday press release , Strategy still has around $16 billion available for issuance in its $21 billion common stock offering , and more than $30 billion available for issuance across its four separate preferred stock offerings— STRF , STRK , STRC , and STRD.</li>
<li>While shares have slumped on the latest Bitcoin buy, analysts at TD Cowen still see the stock as a buy.</li>
