    <ul>
      <li>Despite closing higher in recent sessions, Metaplanet shares are down more than 27% in the past month.</li>
<li>The cryptocurrency trades at $114,509 at press time with a 1.5% price drop in the past week and a 34.63% increase in volume in the past day.</li>
<li>Year-to-date, the firm has recorded yields above 395%, with quarter-to-date returns at 10.3%.</li>
<li>This leaves Metaplanet sitting on nearly $290 million in unrealized profit following the latest buy.</li>
<li>However, the firm’s stock price has faced pressure, slipping nearly 0.5% to 605 JPY as Bitcoin prices remain volatile.</li>
<li>The purchase comes when Bitcoin recently slipped below $115,000, according to CoinMarketCap data.</li>
<li>It also raised $1.45 billion through an international share offering to support its long-term goals.</li>
    </ul>
