    <ul>
      <li>Alphabet generated $96.4 billion in revenue during Q2, making IonQ&#x27;s revenue 0.0218% of Alphabet&#x27;s total.</li>
<li>In Q2, it recognized revenue of $21 million, which is a rounding error compared to Alphabet&#x27;s results.</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $651,345 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005...</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,080,327 !* Now, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,058 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 189% for the S&amp;P 500.</li>
<li>Consider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004...</li>
<li>IonQ must achieve quantum computing relevancy, or the stock will go to $0.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, if this happens to IonQ, the stock would likely go to $0, losing investors a ton of money.</li>
