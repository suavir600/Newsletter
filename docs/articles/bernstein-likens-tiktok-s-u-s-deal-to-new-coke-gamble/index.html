    <ul>
      <li>Every 5% of TikTok user churn could redirect roughly 8.5 million Americans to rivals, Bernstein calculated.</li>
<li>The framework, outlined this week, calls for a consortium led by Oracle to acquire more than 80% of a new TikTok U.S.</li>
<li>When TikTok temporarily went dark earlier this year, 42% of users shifted to Meta-owned platforms, 14% to YouTube, and 2% to Snapchat.</li>
<li>The platform’s American business could contribute between $18 billion and $25 billion in revenue this year, according to Bernstein estimates.</li>
<li>In advertising, Meta gained quickly: larger advertisers launched 21% more ads and increased daily spending by 68% during the outage, while average CPMs on Meta rose 10% overnight and stayed elevated even after TikTok’s return.</li>
<li>The company, which recently announced $317 billion in new remaining performance obligations, could use TikTok to showcase its AI and cloud services to other consumer internet firms.</li>
<li>TikTok has consistently ranked among the top three most downloaded apps in the U.S., adding 10 to 15 million new downloads each quarter despite uncertainty about its future.</li>
    </ul>
