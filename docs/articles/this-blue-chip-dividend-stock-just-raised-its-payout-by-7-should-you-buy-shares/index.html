      <li>The consensus analyst estimate puts Q3 earnings at $4.73 per share, which would be up 8.24% YoY.</li>
<li>The full-year 2025 estimate is $19.38, also up a solid 6.43% from last year’s $18.21, underscoring strong expected growth even as sector headwinds persist.</li>
<li>Morgan Chase lifted its quarterly dividend to $1.50 per share for Q3 2025, marking a 7% rise from the previous payout and continuing a series of regular hikes—12% in March and 9% in September 2024—with five raises in the last five years and a five-year annualized growth rate of 6.8%.</li>
<li>Morgan’s Q2 2025 earnings report, released in July, shows net revenues came in at $44.91 billion, a figure that marks an 11% year-over-year (YoY) decline but still tops the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $43.81 billion.</li>
<li>With shares now trading at $313.23, this spells a downside of approximately 3.3% from the current level.</li>
<li>This stock is trading at a recent price of $313.23 per share, up 30.67% year-to-date (YTD) and 50.93% over the past 52 weeks.</li>
<li>Recently, the Federal Reserve just cut rates by 25 basis points to a 4.00–4.25% target range, the first move since last December 2024, sharpening the debate over how banks should balance higher payouts with capital discipline as 2025 growth expectations inch higher.</li>
