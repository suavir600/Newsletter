    <ul>
      <li>In the June-ended quarter, iPhone revenue reached $44.6 billion, up 13% year over year, representing roughly 47% of Apple&#x27;s $94.0 billion in total sales.</li>
<li>That was a step up from the March-ended quarter, when iPhone revenue was $46.8 billion, up about 2% year over year, or roughly 49% of Apple&#x27;s $95.4 billion in sales.</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $640,916 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005...</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,090,012 !* Now, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,052 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 188% for the S&amp;P 50</li>
<li>Consider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004...</li>
<li>If these factors go well, fiscal 2026 may shape up as a great iPhone cycle -- and possibly a strong catalyst for the stock.</li>
<li>In the June quarter, total revenue rose 10% and earnings per share climbed 12%, with services reaching a new high and the installed base hitting a fresh record.</li>
