    <ul>
      <li>Revenue advanced by 22% to $47.5 billion.</li>
<li>For the period, revenue slipped by almost 2% year over year to $2.1 billion.</li>
<li>All this filtered down into a headline net income figure that was 36% fatter at $18.3 billion ($7.14 per share).</li>
<li>The company&#x27;s attributable GAAP net income fell by almost 33% to $205 million.</li>
<li>The company booked an all-time record for revenue in that frame; this was a superb 40% higher year-over-year at slightly over $275 million.</li>
<li>That isn&#x27;t surprising, giving the 1% dip in subscriber count (to under 33 million).</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $661,694 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005...</li>
