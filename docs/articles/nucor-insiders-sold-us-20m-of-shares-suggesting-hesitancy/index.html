    <ul>
      <li>Nucor insiders own 0.6% of the company, currently worth about US$207m based on the recent share price.</li>
<li>That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$141.</li>
<li>Nucor Insider Transactions Over The Last Year In the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President, Leon Topalian, sold US$4.3m worth of shares at a price of US$145 per share.</li>
<li>In total, insiders dumped US$11m worth of shares in that time, and we didn&#x27;t record any purchases whatsoever.</li>
<li>While conducting our analysis, we found that Nucor has 3 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore them.</li>
<li>So What Do The Nucor Insider Transactions Indicate?</li>
<li>Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven&#x27;t been buying.</li>
