    <ul>
      <li>Since 2015, the dividend has gone from $1.60 total annually to $5.60.</li>
<li>Looking forward, EPS is forecast to rise by 12.5% over the next 3 years.</li>
<li>Even though the dividend went up, the yield is still quite low at only 1.8%.</li>
<li>This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 13% over that duration.</li>
<li>Analysts forecast the future payout ratio could be 31% over the same time horizon, which is a number we think the company can maintain.</li>
<li>It&#x27;s encouraging to see that JPMorgan Chase has been growing its earnings per share at 22% a year over the past five years.</li>
<li>Past distributions do not necessarily guarantee future ones, but JPMorgan Chase&#x27;s payout ratio of 27% is a good sign as this means that earnings decently cover dividends.</li>
    </ul>
