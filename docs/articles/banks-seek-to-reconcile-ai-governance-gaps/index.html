    <ul>
      <li>The two companies surveyed more than 250 bank technology executives during Q2 2025.</li>
<li>Just a little over 5% of respondents reported strong alignment between AI initiatives and business goals.</li>
<li>Only 7% of the executives surveyed by FICO and Corinium said their organization has fully integrated model monitoring standards.</li>
<li>“These committees really only got going at the end of 2023 or start of 2024 — so they’ve had about 18 months.” AI governance has a lot of ground yet to cover, as agentic solutions join generative AI and machine learning</li>
<li>Hiring of AI governance professionals spread across the 50 banks tracked by Evident and 33 had filled executive-level AI positions.</li>
<li>The number of use cases launched by 50 of the largest global financial companies shot up during the first half of the year, according to an Evident Insights report published last month.</li>
<li>This story was originally published on CIO Dive.</li>
