  <h1>RTX (RTX) Secures US$205 Million Contract for Navy's Phalanx CIWS Production</h1>
  <ul>
<li>Navy for the Phalanx Close-In Weapon System, a noteworthy development amid the recent 14% rise in RTX's stock price over the past quarter.</li>
<li>Raytheon Technologies (RTX) recently secured a $205 million contract with the U.S.</li>
<li>The current share price of $157.52 positions RTX slightly below the analyst consensus price target of $163.68.</li>
<li>In the past year, however, RTX's performance lagged behind the broader Aerospace &amp; Defense industry, which saw a return of 33.7%, while RTX underperformed.</li>
<li>Over the past five years, RTX's total shareholder returns, including share price appreciation and dividends, reached 186.03%, underscoring its strong long-term performance.</li>
<li>Given the $205 million and $250 million deal sizes, these contracts should drive incremental revenue growth and support profit margin improvement, aligning with analysts' expectations of gradual revenue and profit expans</li>
<li>RTX has 3 warning signs (and 1 which is a bit unpleasant) we think you should know about.</li>
