      <li>The National Institute of Standards and Technology finalized three main post-quantum digital signature standards in 2024: CRYSTALS-Dilithium, FALCON, and SPHINCS+.</li>
<li>(Source: All-In Podcast) Cybersecurity experts estimate approximately 30% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, roughly 6-7 million BTC worth hundreds of billions of dollars, remains vulnerable to potential quantum attacks.</li>
<li>Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko urged Bitcoin to accelerate quantum-resistant upgrades, warning there’s a 50% chance of a quantum breakthrough within five years that could compromise existing cryptographic security.</li>
<li>According to a Cryptonew interview in April, John Lilic, CEO of Telos and an early Ethereum contributor, has stopped making deals involving tokens after 2027 or 2028 based on his quantum timeline research.</li>
<li>Speaking at the All-In Summit 2025, Yakovenko said Bitcoin should migrate to quantum-resistant signature schemes as AI acceleration makes the timeline from research to implementation “ astounding .” His warning aligns with growing industry concerns about quantum computers’ ability to break elliptic curve cryptography , which protects Bitcoin wallets.</li>
<li>Dating back to 2017, researchers, including Divesh Aggarwal and Gavin Brennen, initially warned that elliptic curve cryptography could be broken “ as early as 2027 .” Story Continues However, Gavin Brennen from Macquarie University recently updated his assessment, noting that required quantum computer sizes have dropped from 10-20 million qubits to around one million.</li>
<li>Current quantum machines have around 1,000 qubits, but experts estimate thousands or millions would be needed to threaten crypto security.</li>
