    <ul>
      <li>After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $86.72, up 3.7% from previous close.</li>
<li>Estée Lauder is up 17.2% since the beginning of the year, but at $86.72 per share, it is still trading 14% below its 52-week high of $100.78 from September 2024.</li>
<li>The beauty giant&#x27;s fourth-quarter net sales declined 12% year-over-year, and it also warned of a potential $100 million impact from tariffs, leading to an annual profit forecast below analyst estimates.</li>
<li>Just the day before, the company reported a net loss of $1.13 billion for fiscal 2025, marking its third straight year of falling sales.</li>
<li>This 15% upward adjustment in the target price signals a more bullish view from the analyst firm.</li>
<li>What Is The Market Telling Us Estée Lauder’s shares are very volatile and have had 20 moves greater than 5% over the last year.</li>
<li>Shares of beauty products company Estée Lauder (NYSE:EL) jumped 3.5% in the afternoon session after an analyst at Evercore ISI Group reiterated a positive outlook on the company, raising the firm&#x27;s price target.</li>
