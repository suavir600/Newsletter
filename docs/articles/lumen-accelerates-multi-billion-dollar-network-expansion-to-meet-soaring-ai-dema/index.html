      <li>The Lumen network achieves latency less than five milliseconds at the edge, covering up to 97% of U.S.</li>
<li>Discover how Lumen is executing its Big Build Learn more about Lumen network investments 1 – All figures as of 9/1/25 2- 25% less fiber optic loss per km; less loss translates to less frequent need for fiber optic signal regeneration, decreasing equipment costs; figure is based on a comparison to vintage 2000 fiber (decrease from .22 db/km loss to.17 db/km).</li>
<li>By using fiber with 25% less optical loss than competitors 2 and 60% more capacity than traditional designs, PCF helps move data more efficiently and at greater scale.</li>
<li>Extended Faster Speeds : Earmarked more than $100 million to bring high-speed connectivity up to 400Gbps across clouds, data centers, and metros, creating a more seamless, high-performance pipeline for AI workloads.</li>
<li>The Lumen 400G-enabled network now spans more than 100,000 route miles .</li>
<li>Constructed Signal Boosters: Construction efforts underway at 176 In-Line Amplifier (ILA) sites .</li>
<li>With construction underway coast-to-coast, Lumen is moving forward a multi-billion-dollar build with plans to add 34 million new intercity fiber miles by the end of 2028, for a total of 47 million intercity fiber miles.</li>
