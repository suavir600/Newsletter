  <h1>Elon Musk buys $1B in Tesla stock: What it signals to investors</h1>
  <ul>
<li>Purchases are rare from Musk, who last purchased $10 million of Tesla's shares back in February 2020.</li>
<li>Tesla (TSLA) stock pops after CEO Elon Musk bought roughly $1 billion in shares.</li>
<li>And I'm not sure if this has been mentioned yet, but Elon hasn't bought shares since 2020.</li>
<li>100% and it's a sign that he is all in, especially after the company's board proposed that massive pay package with some really lofty targets in there.</li>
<li>All right, when billionaires bet on themselves, a charge has been sent through Tesla's stock on news Elon Musk bought 2.57 million shares at various prices on Friday for a total of about $1 billion.</li>
<li>He says, these buys are a a clear sign of confidence by Musk in the outlook for Tesla.</li>
<li>I'm not so sure with the economy slowing down, so this might be more of a temporary pop.</li>
</ul>
