      <li>Revenue is projected to rise by only 5% (at the midpoint) in fiscal 2025.</li>
<li>In the five years leading up to its all-time high in December 2023, the stock had soared 321%.</li>
<li>5, Lululemon shares have declined a gut-wrenching 53% over the trailing-five-year period.</li>
<li>Lululemon&#x27;s growth has slowed dramatically, with same-store sales in the Americas region falling 4% in Q2.</li>
<li>Should you invest $1,000 in Lululemon Athletica Inc.</li>
<li>An initial $1,000 investment would be worth just $470 today.</li>
<li>That&#x27;s a truly disappointing outcome, especially when you consider the fact that the S&amp;P 500 index has climbed 89% during the same time.</li>
