      <li>Enphase is down 46.4% since the beginning of the year, and at $38.28 per share, it is trading 68% below its 52-week high of $119.74 from September 2024.</li>
<li>What Is The Market Telling Us Enphase’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 46 moves greater than 5% over the last year.</li>
<li>The previous big move we wrote about was 6 days ago when the stock dropped 1.4% on the news that the major indices continued to retreat (Nasdaq -1.5%, S&amp;P 500 -1.2%) amid profit-taking and renewed concerns about tariffs.</li>
<li>Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Enphase’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $588.48.</li>
<li>Rising Treasury yields added to the pressure, with the 10-year climbing above 4.2% and the 30-year nearing 5%, intensifying worries about stretched equity valuations.</li>
<li>Shares of home energy technology company Enphase (NASDAQ:ENPH) fell 4.3% in the afternoon session after S&amp;P Global announced the company will be dropped from the S&amp;P 500 index.</li>
<li>The change, part of a quarterly rebalancing, will take effect before the opening bell on September 22.</li>
