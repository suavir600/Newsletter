    <ul>
      <li>Last year&#x27;s Q3 revenue was $628 million, so the new outlook implies growth of roughly 14% year over year.</li>
<li>After joining the S&amp;P 500 this summer, The Trade Desk&#x27;s shares tumbled and are now down more than 60% year to date, making it one of 2025&#x27;s most bruised large caps.</li>
<li>Even when excluding political spend from last year&#x27;s Q3 in the comparison, The Trade Desk&#x27;s Q3 2025 guidance calls for just 18% growth -- a huge slowdown from the 27% growth posted in 2024&#x27;s Q3.</li>
<li>The Trade Desk posted a respectable Q2 with revenue increasing 19% year over year to $694 million, customer retention staying above 95%, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) reaching $271 million.</li>
<li>For Q3, the company guided to at least $717 million of revenue and about $277 million of adjusted EBITDA.</li>
<li>Revenue rose 21% year over year to roughly $2.4 billion, da Vinci procedures climbed about 17%, and the company placed 395 systems as its installed base grew 14% to more than 10,000.</li>
<li>For the full year, Intuitive expects worldwide procedure growth of about 15.5% to 17%.</li>
    </ul>
