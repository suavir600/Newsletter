<li>“It's a valueless ERC-721, so technically an NFT, but we just didn't brand it as such.</li>
<li>We weren't trying to sell these or sort of generate any like short term revenue.</li>
<li>The travel experience tokens, which are technically NFTs (ERC 721 tokens), are minted and stored on Coinbase’s Base network, said Colin Marlowe , VP, Emerging Partnerships at Amex Digital Labs.</li>
<li>The Amex travel app also includes a range of tools for travels and Centurion Lounge upgrades, the company said.</li>
<li>“As an identifier and representation of history the stamps could create interesting partnership angles over time.</li>
<li>The angle is to make a travel experience with Amex feel really rich, really different, and kind of set it apart,” he said.</li>
<li>Fireblocks is also involved, supporting Amex as its Wallet-as-a-Service provider for the passport product, a Fireblocks representative said.</li>
