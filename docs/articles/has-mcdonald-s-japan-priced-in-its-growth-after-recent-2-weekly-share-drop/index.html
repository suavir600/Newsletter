<li>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests McDonald&#x27;s Holdings Company (Japan) may be overvalued by 51.1%.</li>
<li>Looking at recent moves, the past week saw the share price slip by 2.0%, while the 30-day return was nearly flat at -0.3%.</li>
<li>Analysts forecast steady growth, with projections suggesting the free cash flow could rise to about ¥31.1 billion by the end of 2027.</li>
<li>But if you zoom out, the story becomes more interesting: year-to-date, the stock has managed a gain of 3.9%, and the long-term trends look healthy, with a 32.5% jump over the past three years and almost 30% up over five</li>
