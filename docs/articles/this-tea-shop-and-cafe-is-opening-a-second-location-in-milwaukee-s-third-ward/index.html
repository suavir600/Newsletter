      <li>Mallett used the $10,000 prize as startup capital for the second location.</li>
<li>It&#x27;ll be a scaled-down version of her flagship store, at 1819 N.</li>
<li>Mallett&#x27;s second location — in the Third Ward’s Marshall Building, 207 E.</li>
<li>Modeling Ray Kroc&#x27;s business acumen without the ruthlessness Mallett first opened HoneyBee Sage when she moved back home to Milwaukee in 2017.</li>
<li>“But I wanted — like the McDonald brothers — to keep the integrity of our practices and quality of our products.&quot; The 2016 movie is a docudrama about how Kroc forced the McDonald brothers out of their namesake hamburger</li>
<li>The Marshall Building did kind of fall in my lap,” she said.</li>
<li>The 500-square-foot space will offer a selection of grab-and-go items, including sandwiches, soups and salads.</li>
