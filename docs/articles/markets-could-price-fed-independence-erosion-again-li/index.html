<li>BlackRock&#x27;s Wei Li says the cooling down of the US jobs market creates &quot;enough macro justification for the Fed to go ahead with near-term rate cuts&quot; without the central bank&#x27;s independence being brought into question.</li>
<li>She also adds that markets could start to price back in some of the &quot;previous independence erosion premia,&quot; which can have a positive effect on equities and bonds.</li>
