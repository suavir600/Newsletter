    <ul>
      <li>Despite the launch of its Gaudi AI accelerator, Intel&#x27;s revenue from its data center and AI segment rose just 4% to $3.9 billion in the second quarter.</li>
<li>Both stocks rose on the news, with Intel surging 23% in afternoon trading on Thursday, while Nvidia was up 4%.</li>
<li>The Motley Fool recommends Nebius Group and recommends the following options: short November 2025 $21 puts on Intel.</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $661,694 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005...</li>
<li>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , the world&#x27;s biggest chip manufacturer, was also down 2% at the open but swung into positive territory.</li>
<li>if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,082,963 !* Now, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,067 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 190% for the S&amp;P 500.</li>
<li>Nvidia is investing $5 billion in Intel.</li>
