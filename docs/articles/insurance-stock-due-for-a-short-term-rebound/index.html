    <ul>
      <li>A move of similar magnitude from the security&#x27;s current perch at $78.52 would put it just above $82.</li>
<li>This has happened seven other times over the past three years, after which the equity was higher one month later 86% of the time, averaging an 4.5% gain.</li>
<li>Options traders are pricing in low volatility expectations at the moment, per AIG&#x27;s Schaeffer&#x27;s Volatility Index (SVI) of 21%, which ranks in the low 8th percentile of its annual range.</li>
<li>Per Schaeffer&#x27;s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, AIG is within 0.75 of the 260-day trendline&#x27;s 20-day average true range (ATR), after spending at least 80% of the last 10 days and 80% of the last two months above</li>
<li>American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG) stock is still pulling back from its late August peak after running into pressure at the $84 level, which provided support in June.</li>
<li>When weighing in on American International Group stock&#x27;s next move, options look like a good way to go.</li>
<li>While AIG may have trouble overcoming that particular obstacle, a signal flashing shows it could run back toward it very soon.</li>
