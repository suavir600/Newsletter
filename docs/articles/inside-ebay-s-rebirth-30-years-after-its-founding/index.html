      <li>40% of what we sell is used or refurbished.</li>
<li>Our US business grew 7% last quarter and our focus categories grew 10%.</li>
<li>Uh, you know, I would like to say the average household has $300 to $4000 of stuff that could be sold on eBay and less than 20% of that is online.</li>
<li>I&#x27;ve been around eBay since 2001.</li>

<li>That&#x27;s exactly right, for about $14.83.</li>
<li>Collectibles for us is over $10 billion on the platform.</li>
    </ul>
