  <h1>Inside eBay’s rebirth 30 years after its founding</h1>
  <ul>
<li>40% of what we sell is used or refurbished.</li>
<li>Our US business grew 7% last quarter and our focus categories grew 10%.</li>
<li>Uh, you know, I would like to say the average household has $300 to $4000 of stuff that could be sold on eBay and less than 20% of that is online.</li>
<li>I've been around eBay since 2001.</li>
<li>So go back to when I started in 2001.</li>
<li>That's exactly right, for about $14.83.</li>
<li>Collectibles for us is over $10 billion on the platform.</li>
</ul>
