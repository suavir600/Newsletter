  <h1>Why Broadcom Rallied Today</h1>
  <ul>
<li>Shares of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) rallied on Monday, up 3.6% as of 12:20 p.m.</li>
<li>The massive 32% increase is now one of the highest price targets on Wall Street, with the current Street-high price target of $416.</li>
<li>Citi analyst Atif Malik said the lowered price target reflects a 4% cut to next year's Nvidia revenue estimates.</li>
<li>The move was all the more notable since the stock rallied 9.4% last Friday, following last Thursday's earnings release.</li>
<li>Malik now sees a total $12 billion worth of Nvidia GPU revenue going to OpenAI's internal chip effort in collaboration with Broadcom.</li>
<li>The optimism over the new account continued today, as sell-side analysts at Argus Research increased their price target on Broadcom's stock from $285 to $375.</li>
<li>Interestingly, not only did Broadcom receive another in a line of analyst upgrades, but analysts at Citigroup even lowered their Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) price target by $10 due to the Broadcom coup, albeit retaining a buy</li>
</ul>
