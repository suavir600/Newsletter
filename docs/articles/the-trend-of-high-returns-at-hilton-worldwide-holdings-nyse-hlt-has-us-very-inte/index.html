    <ul>
      <li>Thus, Hilton Worldwide Holdings has an ROCE of 21%.</li>
<li>We found that the returns on capital employed over the last five years have risen by 348%.</li>
<li>That&#x27;s a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 10% earned by companies in a similar industry.</li>
<li>Essentially the business now has suppliers or short-term creditors funding about 29% of its operations, which isn&#x27;t ideal.</li>
<li>To calculate this metric for Hilton Worldwide Holdings, this is the formula: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 0.21 = US$2.4b ÷ (US$16b - US$4.6b)</li>
<li>Speaking of capital employed, the company is actually utilizing 24% less than it was five years ago, which can be indicative of a business that&#x27;s improving its efficiency.</li>
