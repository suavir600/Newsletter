<li>0409 ET – Novartis’s $1.4 billion deal to buy Tourmaline Bio looks like a strategically meaningful move that is set to complement its cardiovascular-treatment pipeline, Vontobel analyst Stefan Schneider writes.</li>
<li>Tourmaline Bio is a U.S.</li>
<li>biopharmaceutical company developing pacibekitug, a promising treatment candidate for clogged heart and blood vessels in advanced phase 2 trials.</li>
<li>The deal makes sense for the Swiss pharmaceutical group as it bolsters the company’s franchise catering to cardiovascular patients with underserved needs, specifically anti-inflammatory therapies, Schneider adds.</li>
