      <li>The reinsurance industry covered just over 10% of total insured catastrophe losses last year, compared with about 25% in 2019 and well below the historical average of 20%, according to S&amp;P.</li>
<li>This year, natural catastrophes are set to drive insured losses past $150 billion, which is well above the 10-year-average, according to risk modeler Verisk.</li>
<li>Big reinsurers now have enough capital to handle insured losses equivalent to three Hurricane Katrinas in a single year, or roughly $300 billion, while maintaining their existing credit ratings, according to S&amp;P.</li>
<li>“That is remarkable,” Ashworth said.</li>
<li>“I don’t expect the pendulum to swing back anytime soon,” he said in an interview.</li>
<li>Over the past half decade, the top 19 global reinsurers have more than halved their exposure to insured catastrophe losses, and will likely continue to bear a smaller burden than they have historically, according to Simo</li>
<li>The industry has built considerable buffers after years of dodging losses and accumulating capital via investments.</li>
