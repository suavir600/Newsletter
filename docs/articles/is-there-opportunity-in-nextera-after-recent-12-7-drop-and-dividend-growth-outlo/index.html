    <ul>
      <li>Over the past week, shares have inched up 2.7%.</li>
<li>For NextEra Energy, the latest annual dividend per share stands at $2.56, with an estimated dividend growth rate of about 3.1%.</li>
<li>Still, if you widen the lens to the past five years, NextEra Energy is up a respectable 17.7%.</li>
<li>The model calculates an intrinsic share value of $69.15.</li>
<li>If you zoom out to a month or more, you’ll notice a drop of 5.0% in 30 days and even a 12.7% decline in the past year.</li>
<li>The company’s payout ratio is roughly 61%, meaning just over half of its earnings are returned to shareholders as dividends.</li>
<li>Analysts expect the return on equity to remain near 9.5%, which supports continued dividend growth within a sustainable range.</li>
