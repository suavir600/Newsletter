  <h1>Hesai Showcases Next-Gen High-Performance Lidars at IAA Mobility 2025, Mass Production Expected in 2026</h1>
  <ul>
<li>FTX is slated for mass production in 2026.</li>
<li>Mass production is expected in 2026, accelerating large-scale deployment of L3 autonomous driving worldwide.</li>
<li>In challenging scenarios such as highly reflective objects or rain and fog, ETX achieves a breakthrough with a 95% reduction in false positive rate (3).</li>
<li>Despite its industry-leading performance, ETX has a compact 32 mm height that is 35% smaller than comparable products (2), making it ideal for seamless behind-the-windshield integration.</li>
<li>As the star product of Hesai's IAA Mobility showcase, ETX stands out with its unmatched 800-channel count, 400 m ranging capability at 10% reflectivity, and finest resolution at 0.05° × 0.025°.</li>
<li>It is 66% lighter than its prior model (4), with an exposed optical window of just 50 × 30 mm, enabling flexible integration for precise detection of low obstacles such as road posts, while supporting autonomous parking</li>
<li>Intelligent Point Cloud Engine (IPE): Built on principals of quantum optics, this engine leverages 24.6 billion samples/sec ultra-fast sampling to remove over 99.9% of environmental noise in challenging conditions such a</li>
