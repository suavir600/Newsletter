      <li>Shares of MSTR were down 2.5% in premarket trading alongside a sizable slide in the price of bitcoin to about the $112,000.</li>
<li>The company Monday said it bought another 850 BTC for $99.7 million, increasing its total holdings to 639,,825 coins.</li>
<li>This purchase was made at an average price of $117,344 per bitcoin, lifting the company’s overall average purchase price to $73,971.</li>
<li>This latest acquisition was funded through the issuance of perpetual preferred stock and common stock at-the-market (ATM), though about 80% of that funding was through common stock sales.</li>
<li>Strategy (MSTR) continued to add to its bitcoin (BTC) stash last week, though it was a relatively small purchase.</li>
