  <h1>From Test Flights to e-Fuels: Decoding Boeing's SAF Initiatives</h1>
  <ul>
<li>ERJ has been using SAF in operations since 2021 and aims to reach at least 25% by 2040.</li>
<li>By 2030, all Airbus aircraft and helicopters are projected to be capable of flying with up to 100% SAF.</li>
<li>Looking ahead, Boeing’s commitment includes ensuring that all its new aircraft are 100% SAF-capable by 2030.</li>
<li>In particular, commercial aviation, responsible for 2-3% of global CO???</li>
<li>Notably, all Airbus aircraft are currently capable of flying on a maximum 50% blend of SAF and conventional fuel.</li>
<li>A decade later, its ecoDemonstrator program performed the first commercial flight using 100% SAF on a 777 Freighter with FedEx.</li>
<li>However, although SAF offers up to 80% lifecycle emission reduction without aircraft modifications, its production remains below 1% of global jet fuel demand.</li>
</ul>
