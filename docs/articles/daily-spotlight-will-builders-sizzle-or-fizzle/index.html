    <ul>
      <li>With 30-year mortgage rates of 6.25%, down from 6.9% in June, there are anecdotal reports of increasing buyer interest.</li>
<li>The Zillow Home Value Index rose by an annual 0.3% in July.</li>
<li>Builder sentiment has been flat for the last five months, according to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), and building permits are down 11% over the last year.</li>
<li>This Wednesday, we expect the Census Bureau to report that August new home sales declined about 7.7% from a year earlier to 640,000 SAAR.</li>
<li>Shares of homebuilders have raised the roof, rising 14% over the last six months despite strained housing affordability and a sluggish economy.</li>
<li>With soft job growth and slightly restrictive monetary policy, we expect inflation expectations to ease as long as cost pressures from tariffs remain muted and peak in early 2026.</li>
<li>On September 30, we expect the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index will post an annual increase of 1.5% for July, a continuing deceleration from the 1.9% increase in June.</li>
    </ul>
