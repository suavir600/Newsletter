<li>According to Coingecko, the Solana price is up a decent +53% in the past year and +10% in the last month of trading.</li>

<li>On X, one analyst said the rejection at $250 was expected.</li>
<li>He adds that as long as SOL USD stays above $185, the Solana price is “programmed” for $500.</li>
<li>Although the uptrend remains, there needs to be a conclusive close above September highs at around $250.</li>
<li>Due to SOL USD exposure, share prices have also ticked higher as shareholders rode the SOL price boom for the better part of Q3 2025.</li>
