    <ul>
      <li>Uber shares were down about 5% following the announcement on Wednesday morning.</li>
<li>Uber&#x27;s market cap, however, is $195 billion, dwarfing Lyft&#x27;s $9 billion valuation.</li>
<li>It could be worth more than $330 billion by 2030, with robotaxi-type services pushing the industry forward and reducing costs by — among other factors —not requiring a human driver.</li>
<li>Even so, the firm &quot;would like to see positive fundamental trends sustained over time to become constructive on the shares.&quot; Lyft stock is up 70% year to date versus Uber&#x27;s 48% rise during the same period.</li>
<li>Riders can initially hail driverless cars through the Waymo app, with plans to integrate the fleet into Lyft’s platform later in 2026.</li>
<li>Goldman analyst Mark Delaney estimates the market for traditional ride-hailing in the US is worth approximately $58 billion currently.</li>
<li>Lyft ( LYFT ) stock surged 13% Wednesday after the company announced a partnership with Alphabet’s ( GOOG ) self-driving Waymo service to roll out an autonomous ride-hailing service in Nashville next year.</li>
    </ul>
