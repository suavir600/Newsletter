<li>Boost your income stream and market resilience when you target dividend stocks with yields &gt; 3% for stocks paying over 3% yields with the fundamentals to support them.</li>
<li>If they are able to do this, maintain a 70% operational margin, increase profitability by cutting costs and expanding margins, and pay down debt, in the long term I see good annual returns (low double digits) from current stock price levels.</li>
<li>Result: Fair Value of $30.62 (UNDERVALUED) Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what&#x27;s behind the forecasts.</li>
<li>PFE Discounted Cash Flow as at Sep 2025 Simply Wall St performs a discounted cash flow (DCF) on every stock in the world every day ( check out Pfizer for example ).</li>
<li>Also, I think they will continue to release many new products that are already in phase 3 of research.</li>
