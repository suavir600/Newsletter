  <h1>CAVA Scales Kitchen Tech: Can Efficiency Power the Next Growth Leg?</h1>
  <ul>
<li>In second-quarter 2025, revenues increased 20.3% year over year to $278.2 million, while adjusted EBITDA rose 22.6% to $42.1 million.</li>
<li>CAVA is also scaling AI vision technology, extending real-time production monitoring to 21 additional restaurants in 2025.</li>
<li>At the center of this strategy is the rollout of kitchen display systems, which are expected to be live in 270 restaurants by 2025-end.</li>
<li>Restaurant-level margins held steady at 26.3%, supported by disciplined cost control despite modest 2.1% same-store sales growth and flat traffic.</li>
<li>Management expects these investments to reinforce Chipotle’s path back to mid-single-digit comp growth and sustain restaurant-level margins near the high-20% range.</li>
<li>Alongside this, the deployment of TurboChef ovens across the fleet by 2025 is designed to accelerate cooking times while ensuring quality consistency.</li>
<li>With $385.8 million in cash and no debt, CAVA maintains significant balance sheet flexibility to invest in pilots and systemwide rollouts without straining capital resources.</li>
</ul>
