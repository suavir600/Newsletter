      <li>By contrast, the Pro Max commanded a premium of 5% to 28% across all 12 variants, versus last year when only nine variants traded at a premium.</li>
<li>Jefferies noted that “the US is still the weakest and, bear in mind the US is the largest iPhone market (33% of global unit volume).” China stands out as particularly strong, with the iPhone 17 base model’s lead time exceeding 35 days, helped by Apple’s “aggressive pricing (11-14% cut vs 16) and the 256GB being qualified for gov subsidies.” The firm added that the Pro Max has also seen rising wait times in China, though largely because the Air model is unavailable there.</li>
<li>In the resale market, Jefferies found “no bid for iPhone 17 base model” and “no bid for 17 Air,” while the Pro showed only a modest premium.</li>
<li>The firm’s analysts said that their “tracking of global lead time and HK’s resale prices indicates rising demand for iPhone 17, although the US is likely the weakest.” The firm said that delivery times have lengthened across all six tracked markets since pre-orders began on September 12, with the base, Pro, and Pro Max models all showing higher year-on-year lead times, except in the United States.</li>
<li>Still, Jefferies cautioned that “downside risk for AAPL in ASP” remains, as strength in the base model “would not be able to offset weaknesses in 17 Air and Pro.” Related articles Jefferies sees a downside risk for Apple amid softer iPhone average selling prices 5 High-Yield Dividend Stocks for Reliable Income Amid September Volatility EUR/USD Could Rebound as Bond-Driven US Dollar Strength Looks Overdone</li>
