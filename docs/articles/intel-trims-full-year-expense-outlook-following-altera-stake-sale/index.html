      <li>As an Intel segment in the first half of 2025, Altera reported a 55% gross margin on $816 million in revenue and $356 million in operating expenses.</li>
<li>In April, Intel agreed to sell 51% of Altera to private equity firm Silver Lake, valuing the unit at $8.75 billion, well below the nearly $17 billion Intel paid in 2015.</li>
<li>Intel kept its 2026 full-year operating expense target at $16 billion.</li>
<li>government has taken a 10% equity stake by converting Biden-era grants into shares.</li>
<li>The company recorded an annual loss of $18.8 billion in 2024, its first such loss since 1986, after former CEO Pat Gelsinger poured billions into expanding its loss-making contract-manufacturing business.</li>
<li>(Reuters) - Intel said on Monday it has lowered its full-year 2025 adjusted operating expense target to $16.8 billion, from $17 billion earlier, to reflect the deconsolidation of its programmable chip business, Altera.</li>
<li>Shares of the struggling chipmaker rose nearly 4% as the trimmed projected expenses provided investors with some respite after burgeoning costs left Intel with a strained balance sheet.</li>
