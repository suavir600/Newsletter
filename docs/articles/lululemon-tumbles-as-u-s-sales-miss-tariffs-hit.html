  <h1>Lululemon Tumbles as U.S. Sales Miss, Tariffs Hit</h1>
  <ul>
<li>Revenue climbed 6.8% to $2.5 billion, about $40 million shy of expectations, while earnings of $3.10 a share topped forecasts by $0.25 but dipped slightly from a year ago.</li>
<li>Tariffs alone are expected to trim $240 million from gross profit.</li>
<li>Gross margin slipped 110 basis points to 58.5%, still ahead of consensus.</li>
<li>Comparable sales inched up 1%, missing estimates, as stronger traffic in China wasn't enough to offset softness in the Americas.</li>
<li>Lululemon now expects FY25 revenue of $10.85 billion$11 billion, below Wall Street's $11.2 billion call, and profit of $12.77$12.97 a share, well under its prior outlook near $14.70.</li>
<li>Q3 guidance also disappointed, with sales and earnings projected below analyst targets.</li>
<li>Looking ahead, the picture darkened.</li>
</ul>
