      <li>From April through June, Metaplanet posted a BTC yield of 129.4%.</li>
<li>Shares are down more than 30% over the past month, hit by a modest decline in the price of bitcoin along with a shrinking mNAV — the premium of the company market cap versus its bitcoin holdings.</li>
<li>For the third quarter to date, the figure stands at 30.8% The company’s 20,136 BTC stash makes it the sixth-largest publicly traded bitcoin treasury company.</li>
<li>The acquisition was made at an average purchase price just under $112,000 per bitcoin and lifts the total the firm spent on BTC to more than $2 billion.</li>
<li>Collectively, these companies hold over 1 million BTC, with the lion’s share coming from Strategy’s 638,460 bitcoin treasury.</li>
<li>Tokyo-listed firm Metaplanet (MTPLF) has added an additional 136 bitcoin (BTC) to its treasury, after earlier this month taking its holdings to over 20,000 coins.</li>
<li>Metaplanet tracks the performance of its investment through a BTC yield metric, which measures the growth of bitcoin held per fully diluted share rather than traditional yield earned on assets held.</li>
