- In the second quarter, revenue climbed 22% year over year to $47.5 billion, fueling diluted earnings per share (EPS) that jumped 38% to $7.14.
- If the company can achieve that benchmark, it could surpass a $3 trillion market cap as early as 2029.

## Is Palantir Stock About to Breakout?
- Current-quarter earnings estimates are up more than 21%, while projections for next year have climbed 16.7%.
- Sales are expected to surge 46% this year and another 33% in 2026, while earnings are projected to compound at an impressive 40.8% annually over the next three to five years.
- A decisive move above $159 would confirm a breakout and likely pave the way for another leg higher.
- On the other hand, a break below key support near $150 would suggest further downside risk, signaling that investors may want to wait for a better entry point.
- Yet the growth outlook continues to justify bullish sentiment.
- This steady trend in upward revisions has helped Palantir secure a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.
- That skepticism, however, can become a tailwind, pushing shares even higher.

## Filtering Bitcoin is authoritarian
- The Great Bitcoin Filter Debate of 2025 rages on, and it’s getting pretty brutal.
- Despite 100% of users filtering transactions with extremely low fee rates, those transactions were still being mined in over half of the blocks.
- In other words, even with 100% filtering we still see the iron laws of economics prevail: if there’s a paying customer, someone will cash the check.
- One Bitcoin developer who goes by the online pseudonym “PortlandHODL” demonstrates that the number is upwards of 98% of all nodes to impose a modest cost.
- Also called Bitcoin-NFTs, backlash against these Ordinals grew rapidly from there appearance in 2023 and a growing sect of Bitcoiners have advocated for “filtering” these Bitcoin transactions out of the blockchain.
- Let’s take a look at an example from this summer: the filtering of 1 sat/vbyte transactions.
- But, what about…?

## Finance leaders’ risk management views: Study
- In contrast, 64% of respondents believe that these processes provide little to no advantage.
- The report is based on a survey of 273 US organisations, specifically targeting CFOs and senior finance leaders, conducted in Spring 2025.
- The report highlights that 61% of finance leaders acknowledge a significant shift in the volume and complexity of risks over the past five years.
- However, the frequency with which management communicates risk exposure to the board of directors varies, with 57% reporting top risks to the board.
- Additional insights from the report indicate that nearly half (45%) of organisations have appointed a chief risk officer or a senior risk executive equivalent.
- Only 27% of executives believe that their ERM process would aid in identifying and managing a significant risk event that could affect their organisation’s reputation and brand.
- The report identifies competing priorities and insufficient resources (both at 41%) as the primary barriers, along with a perceived lack of value in risk management efforts (29%).

- Its shares rose more than 4% on Monday, closing at a record high near $252.
- The move pushed Alphabet’s (GOOGL) market capitalization above $3 trillion, making it the fourth company to do so.
- With Monday's gains, Alphabet's stock has added roughly a third of its value this year, making it the best-performing member of the Magnificent Seven for 2025 so far.
- The only others to have reached that level are Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and AI darling Nvidia (NVDA), the latter which earlier this year became the first company to top $4 trillion.

- In July, Alphabet reported that cloud revenue leapt nearly 32% year over year to $13.6 billion, with adoption of its in-house Tensor Processing Units and Gemini AI models driving growth, putting Google on pace to generat
- Shares jumped more than 4% to record highs, lifting both of Alphabet’s publicly traded classes into the three-comma club.
- The company also signaled it would spend more aggressively to meet data-center demand, boosting its 2025 capital expenditures plan by $10 billion to $85 billion.
- Google’s move to $3 trillion also comes as Google Cloud is finally throwing its weight around.
- The $3 trillion club is still tiny, but the message is loud: scale, distribution, and power-hungry infrastructure are monetizing AI faster than skeptics expected.
- That puts the company alongside Nvidia , Microsoft, and Apple — three rivals that have already made $3 trillion look routine — and reshuffles a leaderboard that, until recently, looked like a closed shop.
- Alphabet’s late arrival to the $3 trillion club suggests that investors now see AI as an accelerant, not just a cost sink — and that legal uncertainty, for the moment, has receded enough to let the market focus on growth

- Prediction: This "Ten Titans" Growth Stock Will Join Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Broadcom, and Meta Platforms in the $2 Trillion Club by 2030 Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) surged a mind-numbing 36% on Wednesday to
- Now, there's reason to believe it can surpass $2 trillion by 2030.
- Broadcom and Meta Platforms are currently under $2 trillion but would surpass the threshold with gains of 16% or less.
- So it's not unreasonable to expect Oracle to surpass $2 trillion in market cap by 2030 -- again if it delivers on expectations.
- if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $640,916!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005...
- 9, Oracle projected Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) revenue to grow from $18 billion in its current fiscal year to $144 billion by fiscal 2030.
- Oracle's road to $2 trillion is defined, but the path is riddled with uncertainty If Oracle comes close to its fiscal 2030 OCI revenue target, it wouldn't be surprising to see the stock at least double from here.

## Why Analysts Call Broadcom a 'Magnificent Eight' Stock That Can Challenge Nvidia
- If Broadcom were able to capture even 20% of an estimated $2 trillion addressable market for 2030 while Nvidia holds onto a 40% share—down from over 70% currently—both stocks "are going a heck of a lot higher," Melius sa
- Nvidia shares ticked less than 1% higher to end today around $168 after taking a 3% hit in Friday’s session.
- Broadcom’s stock climbed more than 3% to close Monday around $346, adding to a nearly 10% jump Friday after its better-than-expected earnings.
- Citi analysts said the results and growing commitments from buyers—many which are also Nvidia (NVDA) customers—could suggest an estimated $12 billion hit to Nvidia’s 2026 sales.
- “To be clear, we have always taken a view that Nvidia's share of AI compute would actually fall over time as chip designers like Broadcom would gain about 30% of share and a gang of other merchants led by AMD would take
- Citi analysts on Monday maintained a “buy” rating on Nvidia stock but trimmed their target price to $200 from $210, citing concerns about threats to Nvidia's dominance after Broadcom (AVGO) said last week it expects dema
- They see Broadcom as a “Magnificent 8” stock—worthy of joining the group of seven tech heavyweights—with significant room to rise.

## Why Broadcom Rallied Today
- Shares of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) rallied on Monday, up 3.6% as of 12:20 p.m.
- The massive 32% increase is now one of the highest price targets on Wall Street, with the current Street-high price target of $416.
- Citi analyst Atif Malik said the lowered price target reflects a 4% cut to next year's Nvidia revenue estimates.
- The move was all the more notable since the stock rallied 9.4% last Friday, following last Thursday's earnings release.
- Malik now sees a total $12 billion worth of Nvidia GPU revenue going to OpenAI's internal chip effort in collaboration with Broadcom.
- The optimism over the new account continued today, as sell-side analysts at Argus Research increased their price target on Broadcom's stock from $285 to $375.
- Interestingly, not only did Broadcom receive another in a line of analyst upgrades, but analysts at Citigroup even lowered their Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) price target by $10 due to the Broadcom coup, albeit retaining a buy

## American Express Introduces Blockchain-Based ‘Travel Stamps’
- “It's a valueless ERC-721, so technically an NFT, but we just didn't brand it as such.
- We weren't trying to sell these or sort of generate any like short term revenue.

- The Amex travel app also includes a range of tools for travels and Centurion Lounge upgrades, the company said.
- “As an identifier and representation of history the stamps could create interesting partnership angles over time.

- Fireblocks is also involved, supporting Amex as its Wallet-as-a-Service provider for the passport product, a Fireblocks representative said.

## Klarna’s $14 Billion Valuation Draws Out FinTech Bargain Hunters
- In the three months ended June 30, 2025, Klarna’s revenue grew 21% from the prior year to $823 million — that’s less than 3% of the $31.2 billion value of purchases on its network over the same period.
- Meanwhile, Affirm’s revenue swelled by 33% to $876 million with the San Francisco-based firm taking home about 8% of the $10.4 billion of merchandise sold via its lending products.
- Part of the appeal: the buy-now-pay-later lender’s implied market valuation is currently about a 50% discount to rival Affirm Holdings Inc.
- “But one could argue the discount that Klarna is going out with versus Affirm is an attractive one for IPO investors to consider.” Notably, the two companies generated a similar amount of revenue in the latest quarter, b
- Klarna’s average order value was $101 in the past year, whereas Affirm’s was $276 in its most recent quarter.
- The payments company from Sweden’s offering of 34.3 million shares — with more than 80% being sold by early backers — has drawn at least eight times the orders above what’s available, Bloomberg has reported.
- Despite the ebullience, the terms only give Klarna’s IPO a market value of around $14 billion, well shy of Affirm’s current $28 billion-plus market value.

## Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS) Has A Rock Solid Balance Sheet
- And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$1.6b, being 95% of its EBIT.
- As you can see below, at the end of June 2025, Cadence Design Systems had US$2.48b of debt, up from US$1.35b a year ago.
- So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$747.4m.
- However, its balance sheet shows it holds US$3.00b in cash, so it actually has US$522.8m net cash.
- Offsetting this, it had US$3.00b in cash and US$753.8m in receivables that were due within 12 months.
- So it's very unlikely that the US$93.6b company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet.
- During the last three years, Cadence Design Systems generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 95% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect.

## Zscaler CEO says companies need AI to fight AI threats
- Zscaler shares are up over 57% year to date, while Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and CrowdStrike (CRWD) have also surged, suggesting that investors are betting AI will drive new demand for advanced security systems.
- He cited the Colonial Pipeline hack in 2021, which shut down fuel supplies across the East Coast, as an example of how quickly an attack could spiral.
- Zscaler's latest threat report notes the company blocked about 146% more attacks year over year, its biggest spike in three years, while public extortion cases rose over 70%.
- The rise of generative AI agents adds another layer of uncertainty.
- Ransomware is another persistent threat.
- For Zscaler, that opens both risks and opportunities.
- "To fight AI, you must fight it with AI," Chaudry said.

## Why Dollar Tree (DLTR) Stock Is Trading Lower Today
- Dollar Tree is up 27% since the beginning of the year, but at $97.16 per share, it is still trading 17.1% below its 52-week high of $117.16 from August 2025.
- Furthermore, the company reported negative free cash flow of $88.8 million, and the report highlighted that analysts expect revenue to decline by another 9.6% over the next 12 months.
- However, the positive headline numbers were overshadowed by a steep 38.1% year-on-year decline in revenue for the quarter.
- What Is The Market Telling Us Dollar Tree’s shares are quite volatile and have had 16 moves greater than 5% over the last year.
- This follows a period where the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 by about 13%, which the firm attributed to softer comparable sales and weaker-than-expected third-quarter earnings guidance.
- The previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago when the stock dropped 7% as investors appeared to look past the company's second-quarter earnings beat and raised full-year guidance, focusing instead on concerning un

## Elevance Health (NYSE:ELV) Has A Pretty Healthy Balance Sheet
- But it also has US$34.8b in cash to offset that, meaning it has US$4.61b net cash.
- The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Elevance Health had US$30.2b in debt in June 2025; about the same as the year before.
- On the other hand, it had cash of US$34.8b and US$23.0b worth of receivables due within a year.
- So it has liabilities totalling US$20.3b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.
- Check out our latest analysis for Elevance Health But the bad news is that Elevance Health has seen its EBIT plunge 17% in the last twelve months.
- The latest balance sheet data shows that Elevance Health had liabilities of US$43.8b due within a year, and liabilities of US$34.3b falling due after that.
- While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Elevance Health has a huge market capitalization of US$70.6b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to.

## A new class of sleep drugs draws Wall Street’s attention
- Takeda additionally said the median weekly rates of cataplexy decreased more than 80% for oveporexton-treated patients during its studies.
- The exam has several rounds, with each lasting roughly 40 minutes.
- The median number of days per week that patients experienced no cataplexy had also grown, from 0 to between 4 and 5.

## If You'd Invested $1,000 in Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Stock 5 Years Ago, Here's How Much You'd Have Today
- Sure, you gained money instead of losing it, but know that the $1,359 reflects an average annual growth rate of just 6.3%.
- Its most recent increase, of 4.8%, was its 63rd consecutive annual increase.
- That's far less than the average annual gain of close to 10% for the S&P 500 index.
- It's growing, too, with second-quarter revenue up 5.8% year over year and earnings rising 18%.
- Worse still, the S&P 500 has had a great run over the past five years, averaging annual gains of 14.7% -- enough to turn $1,000 into $1,989.
- It would be worth $1,359.
- For starters, Johnson & Johnson is a dividend-paying stock, with a recent dividend yield of 2.9%.

## Lululemon Stock May Be Down 57% This Year, But Is It Out?
- Regarding moderating growth, Lululemon's Q2 revenue in the Americas was only up 1%.
- Now the company's EPS guidance range is $12.77 to $12.97 -- a 14% reduction from the previous midpoint to the current midpoint.

- More encouragingly, the company's international revenue was up a strong 22%.

- Revenue climbed 6.8% to $2.5 billion, about $40 million shy of expectations, while earnings of $3.10 a share topped forecasts by $0.25 but dipped slightly from a year ago.
- Tariffs alone are expected to trim $240 million from gross profit.
- Gross margin slipped 110 basis points to 58.5%, still ahead of consensus.
- Comparable sales inched up 1%, missing estimates, as stronger traffic in China wasn't enough to offset softness in the Americas.
- Lululemon now expects FY25 revenue of $10.85 billion$11 billion, below Wall Street's $11.2 billion call, and profit of $12.77$12.97 a share, well under its prior outlook near $14.70.
- Q3 guidance also disappointed, with sales and earnings projected below analyst targets.
- Looking ahead, the picture darkened.

- As a next step, we compared Loblaw Companies' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 3.3%.

## Has McDonald's Japan Priced In Its Growth After Recent 2% Weekly Share Drop?
- Looking further ahead, estimates extend to around ¥36.6 billion by 2035.
- Forecasts beyond 2027 are extrapolated rather than based on direct analyst coverage.
- This implies the current share price is 51.1% higher than what the DCF model determines as fair value.
- Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests McDonald's Holdings Company (Japan) may be overvalued by 51.1%.
- Looking at recent moves, the past week saw the share price slip by 2.0%, while the 30-day return was nearly flat at -0.3%.
- Analysts forecast steady growth, with projections suggesting the free cash flow could rise to about ¥31.1 billion by the end of 2027.
- But if you zoom out, the story becomes more interesting: year-to-date, the stock has managed a gain of 3.9%, and the long-term trends look healthy, with a 32.5% jump over the past three years and almost 30% up over five

## Inflation is the week's watchword
- Bond yields fell, and mortgage rates fell below 6.5%, the lowest level since fall 2024, which could give housing a boost.
- Core PPI is expected at 2.8% year over year.
- It should show a 3.3% year-over-year increase.
- In the the late 1970s and early 1980s, it reached as high as 13.5%.
- It hit 9%-plus during the post-pandemic recovery and forced the Fed to raise rates to curb it.
- The consensus estimate is that the index will be up 2.9% year over year and 3.1% year over year when food and energy are taken out.
- Here we stop to note that the year-over-year increases of both indexes would be higher than the Fed's target of 2% annual inflation.

## McDonald’s Chief Blasts Minimum Wage Loophole for Tipped Workers
- While the federal minimum wage is $7.25, tipped workers only have to be paid $2.13, with tips expected to make up the difference.
- Tip Fatigue: Tipping has encountered significant backlash in recent years as people have been faced with the dreaded “Leave a tip?” prompt on an iPad with some choices upward of 25%.
- This post first appeared on The Daily Upside.
- But workers in many industries still depend on tips.
- IHOP has an advantage over McDonald’s, and it’s not four types of syrup.
- Full-service restaurants, however, have tips built into their business model.
- As tipping fatigue has gained fame (and meme status), Americans are tipping less.

- If the company can achieve that benchmark, it could surpass a $3 trillion market cap as early as 2029.
- if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $640,916 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005...
- For instance, ExxonMobil and General Electric ruled the roost in 2005, with market caps $375 billion and $362 billion, respectively.
- Wall Street's estimates have the company generating revenue of $196 billion in 2025, giving the stock a forward price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of about 10.
- Meta has a market cap of roughly $1.93 trillion (as of this writing), so it will take a stock price increase of roughly 55% to lift its value to $3 trillion.
- if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,090,012 !* Now, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,052 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 188% for the S&P 50

## Morgan Stanley lifts Oracle target ahead of analyst day, flags margin risks
- In fiscal fourth-quarter 2025, Oracle projected more than 100% growth in remaining performance obligations (RPOs), implying a backlog of roughly $280 billion by fiscal 2026.
- Morgan Stanley’s base case assumes that OpenAI could account for roughly 30% of Oracle’s 2029 revenue, making results heavily reliant on the pace and durability of AI infrastructure demand.
- Oracle is set to release fiscal first-quarter results after Tuesday’s close, with Wall Street forecasting earnings of $1.48 per share on sales of $15.04 billion, up 6% and 13% from a year earlier.
- The Wall Street firm sees Oracle’s base case supporting the new $246 target, with a bull scenario pointing to $347 if revenue rises toward $135 billion and margins hold above 40%, but a bear case of $147 if growth underw
- Morgan Stanley’s revised model embeds a revenue compound annual growth rate of more than 20% through FY29.
- The bank’s revised model suggests earnings per share in 2029 of $11.50 to $12.00, compared with the consensus of $12.29.
- Oracle refrained from reiterating its 45%-plus operating margin target for fiscal 2026, with Morgan Stanley now forecasting FY29 margins at about 39%.

## Top analyst says you weren’t crazy for thinking the economy felt worse than it looked the last 3 years. The ‘rolling recession’ just ended
- The jobs report from July shattered the narrative that the economy of 2025 was strong, revising previous figures downward and revealing something close to an 80% collapse in hiring, even as inflation crept upwards and la
- But what if that was the bottom of a secret, “rolling” recession in place for nearly three years, dating back to 2022?
- The new cycle, strategists argue, “is setting up a strong finish into both year-end and 2026,” provided monetary policy remains responsive enough to support growth.
- August was another bad one, with just 22,000 jobs added.
- Morgan Stanley points to April 2025, when the White House announced new tariffs in a move dubbed “Liberation Day,” as the recession’s trough.
- Morgan Stanley projects the Federal Reserve’s rate cuts—already underway from a 100 basis point cut triggered by labor weakness last summer—will power a durable rebound.

## M&T Bank's (NYSE:MTB) investors will be pleased with their solid 141% return over the last five years
- This EPS growth is lower than the 16% average annual increase in the share price.
- But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%.
- Also pleasing for shareholders was the 11% gain in the last three months.
- We should note here that the five-year TSR is more impressive, at 19% per year.
- But this move may well have been assisted by the reasonably buoyant market (up 11% in 90 days).
- During five years of share price growth, M&T Bank achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 8.6% per year.
- Long term M&T Bank Corporation (NYSE:MTB) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 106% in five years.

- Current-quarter earnings estimates are up more than 21%, while projections for next year have climbed 16.7%.
- Sales are expected to surge 46% this year and another 33% in 2026, while earnings are projected to compound at an impressive 40.8% annually over the next three to five years.
- A decisive move above $159 would confirm a breakout and likely pave the way for another leg higher.
- On the other hand, a break below key support near $150 would suggest further downside risk, signaling that investors may want to wait for a better entry point.
- Yet the growth outlook continues to justify bullish sentiment.
- This steady trend in upward revisions has helped Palantir secure a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.
- That skepticism, however, can become a tailwind, pushing shares even higher.

## CRCL: Circle Stock Downgraded to 'Sell' as USDH Threatens USDC
- Sep 8 - Circle Internet Group (CRCL) faces fresh pressure after Compass Point analyst Ed Engel cut his rating to Sell and lowered his price target to $96, a 28% drop.
- He estimates Hyperliquid's incentive program could strip as much as $100 million from Circle's gross profit if customers migrate.
- The downgrade indicates high risk, and it is more momentum-driven than execution-driven.
- This article first appeared on GuruFocus.
- Circle depends on fees tied to USDC market share, so sustained outflows would hit revenue and margins.
- Engel says Hyperliquid's planned USDH stablecoin threatens to pull users and revenue from Circle's USDC.
- Trading and filings will be monitored by market participants to detect evidence of impact early.

## PepsiCo CEO’s Tall Order: Win Over Investor Calling for Strategy Reset

## PepsiCo Showcases Emerging Market Growth: Sustainable or Cyclical?
- Emerging markets like India, parts of Latin America and regions of the Middle East delivered double-digit or mid-single-digit growth in second-quarter 2025, driven by increasing consumption of both snacks and beverages.
- PepsiCo’s Competitors: KO & KDP in Focus Both The Coca-Cola Company KO and Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.
- However, the question remains whether this emerging market growth is sustainable or more cyclical.
- PepsiCo’s reliance on macro factors like inflation, tariffs and currency fluctuations adds another layer of unpredictability.
- The profitability of international operations, once a weakness, has now turned into a strength, which bodes well for long-term resilience.
- Coca-Cola continues to rely on emerging markets as a critical growth engine, with regions such as India, Africa and Southeast Asia driving strong volume and revenue expansion.
- While the company benefits from a growing middle class in many markets, swings in affordability and consumer confidence can quickly impact demand.

- The reinsurance industry covered just over 10% of total insured catastrophe losses last year, compared with about 25% in 2019 and well below the historical average of 20%, according to S&P.
- This year, natural catastrophes are set to drive insured losses past $150 billion, which is well above the 10-year-average, according to risk modeler Verisk.

- “That is remarkable,” Ashworth said.
- “I don’t expect the pendulum to swing back anytime soon,” he said in an interview.

- The industry has built considerable buffers after years of dodging losses and accumulating capital via investments.

- STERIS' (NYSE:STE) stock up by 2.5% over the past three months.
- STERIS' Earnings Growth And 9.3% ROE At first glance, STERIS' ROE doesn't look very promising.
- Even so, STERIS has shown a fairly decent growth in its net income which grew at a rate of 18%.

- However, given that the company's ROE is similar to the average industry ROE of 11%, we may spare it some thought.
- We then compared STERIS' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 13% in the same 5-year period.

## Texas Instruments Incorporated's (NASDAQ:TXN) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 25% Below Its Share Price
- A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate: 10-year free cash flow (FCF)
- In this calculation we've used 10%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.561.
- Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.
- Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$186b÷ ( 1 + 10%)10= US$70b The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$129b.
- In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (3.1%) to estimate future growth.
- In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 10%.
- Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.

- The comments were made during a presentation at Citi's 2025 Global Technology, Media and Telecommunications Conference, where the company noted a gradual recovery across its markets.
- This cautious outlook from a key executive prompted a significant sell-off, with Texas Instruments leading losses among chipmakers in the Nasdaq 100 and weighing on the broader semiconductor industry.

## Zoetis Gains CVMP Backing for Portela, Eyes EU Approval in Cat OA Pain
- ZTS shares have lost 9.1% year to date compared with the industry’s 10.9% growth.
- OA is a progressive joint disease that causes pain and mobility issues in cats, with up to 40% showing clinical signs, though only 18% are formally diagnosed.
- Subject to a favorable outcome, the company anticipates making Portela commercially available in the EU in 2026.
- Based on the CVMP’s recommendation, Zoetis expects the European regulatory body to communicate a final decision during the fourth quarter of 2025.
- What an EU Nod for Portela Will Mean for ZTS?
- While Solensia, approved in more than 40 countries, offers monthly pain relief, Portela (if approved) would provide a long-acting alternative with dosing required only once every three months.
- Designed to provide up to three months of OA pain relief with a single injection, the therapy addresses a significant unmet need in feline care, where treatment options for chronic pain are limited.
